Executive summary 

This  chapter  focuses  on  accelerating  mitigation  and  on  shifting  development  pathways  to  increased 
sustainability, based on literature particularly at national scale. While previous WGIII assessments have 
discussed mitigation pathways, focus on development pathways is more recent. The timeframe is the 
near-term (now up to 2030) to mid-term (2030 to 2050), complementing Chapter 3 on the long-term 
(from 2050 onward). 

An  emissions  gap  persists,  exacerbated  by  an  implementation  gap,  despite  mitigation  efforts 
including  those  in  near-universal  nationally  determined  contributions  (NDCs).  The  “emissions 
gap”  is  understood  as  the  difference  between  the  emissions  with  NDCs  in  2030,  and  mitigation 
pathways consistent with the temperature goals. In general, the term “implementation gap” refers to the 
difference between goals on paper and how they are achieved in practice. In this report, the term refers 
to the gap between mitigation pledges contained in national determined contributions, and the expected 
outcome  of  existing  policies.  There  is  considerable  literature  on  country-level  mitigation  pathways, 
including  but  not  limited  to  NDCs.  Country  distribution  of  this  literature  is  very  unequal  (robust 
evidence, high agreement). Current policies lead to median global GHG emissions of 57 GtCO2-eq with 
a full range of 52-60 by 2030. NDCs with unconditional and conditional elements1 lead to 53 (50-57) 
and 50 (47-55) GtCO2-eq, respectively (medium evidence, medium agreement) (Table 4.3). This leaves 
estimated emissions gaps in 2030 between projected outcomes of unconditional elements of NDCs and 
emissions in scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot of 20-26 GtCO2-eq, 
and  10-17  GtCO2-eq  for  scenarios  that  likely  limit  warming  to  2°C  with  immediate  action.  When 
conditional elements of NDCs are included, these gaps narrow to 16-24 GtCO2-eq and 7-14 GtCO2-eq, 
respectively. {Cross-Chapter Box 4, Figure 1}   

Studies evaluating up to 105 updated NDCs submitted by October 2021 indicate that emissions in 
conditional NDCs have been reduced by 4.5 (2.7-6.3) GtCO2-eq, but only closes the emission gaps 
by about one-third to 2°C and about 20% to 1.5°C compared to the original NDCs submitted in 
2015/16  (medium  evidence,  medium  agreement).  The  magnitude  of  these  emission  gaps  calls  into 
question  whether  current  development  pathways  and efforts to  accelerate mitigation  are  adequate  to 
achieve the Paris mitigation objectives. In addition, an implementation gap exists between the projected 
emissions of ‘current policies’ and the projected emissions resulting from the implementation of the 
unconditional and conditional elements of NDCs, and is estimated to be around 4 and 7 GtCO2-eq in 
2030, respectively (medium evidence, medium agreement), with many countries requiring additional 
policies  and  associated  climate  action  to  meet  their  autonomously  determined  mitigation  targets  as 
specified under the first NDCs (limited evidence). There is, furthermore, a potential difference between 
mitigation targets set in NDCs ex ante and what is achieved ex post. A limited number of studies assess 
the implementation gaps of conditional NDCs in terms of finance, technology and capacity building 
support.  The  disruptions  triggered  by  the  COVID-19  epidemic  increase  uncertainty  over  range  of 
projections relative to pre-COVID-19 literature. As indicated by a growing number of studies at the 
national  and  global  level,  how  large  near-  to  mid-term  emissions  implications  of  the  COVID-19 
pandemic  are,  to  a  large  degree  depends  on  how  stimulus  or  recovery  packages  are  designed.  {4.2, 
4.2.2.5, Cross-Chapter Box 4} 

Given the gaps, there is a need to explore accelerated mitigation (relative to NDCs and current 
policies). There is increasing understanding of the technical content of accelerated mitigation pathways, 
differentiated by national circumstances, with considerable though uneven literature at country-level 
(medium  evidence,  high  agreement).  Transformative  technological  and  institutional  changes  for  the

near-term include demand reductions through efficiency and reduced activity, rapid decarbonisation of 
the  electricity  sector  and  low-carbon  electrification  of  buildings,  industry  and  transport  (robust 
evidence, medium agreement). A focus on energy use and supply is essential, but not sufficient on its 
own – the land sector and food systems deserve attention. The literature does not adequately include 
demand-side options and systems analysis, and captures the impact from non-CO2 GHGs with medium 
confidence  .  Countries  and  regions  will  have different  starting  points for  transition  pathways.  Some 
factors include climate conditions resulting in different heating and cooling needs, endowments with 
different  energy  resources,  patterns  of  spatial  development,  and  political  and  economic  conditions. 
{4.2.5} 

Accelerated  mitigation  alone  may  run  into  obstacles.  If  such  obstacles  are  rooted  in  underlying 
structural features of society, then transforming such structures helps remove obstacles, which amounts 
to shifting development pathways. Various actors have developed an increasing number of mitigation 
strategies up to 2050 (mid-term). A growing number of such strategies aim at net zero GHG or CO2  
emissions,  but  it  is  not  yet  possible  to  draw  global  implications  due  to  the  limited  size  of  sample 
(medium evidence; low agreement). Non-state actors are also engaging in a wide range of mitigation 
initiatives.  When  adding  up  emission  reduction  potentials,  sub-national  and  non-state  international 
cooperative  initiatives  could  reduce  up  to  about  20  GtCO2-eq  in  2030  (limited  evidence,  medium 
agreement).  Yet  perceived  or  real  conflicts  between  mitigation  and  other  Sustainable  Development 
Goals (SDGs) can impede such action. If undertaken without precaution, accelerated mitigation is found 
to have significant implications for development objectives and macroeconomic costs at country level. 
For example, most country-level mitigation modelling studies in which GDP is an endogenous variable 
report negative impacts of mitigation on GDP in 2030 and 2050, relative to the reference. In all reviewed 
studies, however, GDP continues to grow even with mitigation (robust evidence, high agreement). The 
literature finds that employment effect of mitigation policies tends to be limited on aggregate, but can 
be  significant  at  sectoral  level  (limited  evidence,  medium  agreement).  Detailed  design  of  mitigation 
policies is critical for distributional impacts and avoiding lock-in (robust evidence, high agreement), 
though further research is needed in that direction. {4.2.3, 4.2.4, 4.2.6}  

Shifting  development  pathways  towards  sustainability  offers  ways  to  (i)  broaden  the  range  of 
levers  and  enablers  that  a  society  can  use  to  provide  enabling  conditions  and  accelerate 
mitigation; and (ii) increase the chances of advancing at the same time towards mitigation and 
towards other development goals. The way countries develop determines their capacity to accelerate 
mitigation  and  achieve  other  sustainable  development  objectives  simultaneously  (medium-robust 
evidence,  medium  agreement).  Yet  meeting  ambitious  mitigation  and  development  goals  cannot  be 
achieved  through  incremental  change,  hence  the  focus  on  shifting  development  pathways  (robust 
evidence, medium agreement). Though development pathways result from the actions of a wide range 
of  actors,  it  is  possible  to  shift  development  pathways  through  policies  and  enhancing  enabling 
conditions (limited evidence, medium agreement). For example, policies such as those listed in Table 
4.12 are typically associated with broader objectives than greenhouse gas mitigation. They are generally 
conceived  and  implemented  in  the  pursuit  of  overall  societal  development  objectives,  such  as  job 
creation, macro-economic stability, economic growth, and public health and welfare. In some countries, 
such  policies  are  framed  as  part  of  a  just  transition.  However,  they  can  have  major  influence  on 
mitigative capacity, and hence can be seen as tools to broaden mitigation options, as illustrated by the 
Illustrative Mitigation Pathway “Shifting Pathways” (medium evidence, medium agreement). There are 
practical options to shift development pathways in ways that advance mitigation and other sustainable 
development objectives, supporting political feasibility, increase resources to meet multiple goals, and 
reduce  emissions  (limited  evidence,  high  agreement).  Concrete  examples  assessed  in  this  chapter 
include high employment and low emissions structural change, fiscal reforms for mitigation and social 
contract,  combining  housing  policies  to  deliver  both  housing  and  transport  mitigation,  and  change 
economic,  social  and  spatial  patterns  of  development  of  the  agriculture  sector  provide  the  basis  for

sustained reductions in emissions from deforestation. These examples differ by context. Examples in 
other chapters include transformations in energy, urban, building, industrial, transport, and land-based 
systems, changes in behaviour and social practices, as well as transformational changes across whole 
economies  and  societies.  Coordinated  policy  mixes  would  need  to  coordinate  multiple  actors—
individuals, groups and collectives, corporate actors, institutions and infrastructure actors—to deepen 
decarbonisation and shift pathways towards sustainability. Shifts in one country may spill over to other 
countries. Shifting development pathways can jointly support mitigation and adaptation. Some studies 
explore the risks of high complexity and potential delay attached to shifting development pathways. 
{4.3,  4.3.1,  4.3.2,  4.4.2,  4.4.3,  4.4.1.7-4.4.1.10,  Figure  4.7,  Cross-Chapter  Box  5,  5.8,  Box  6.2,  8.2, 
8.3.1, 8.4, 9.8.1, 9.8.2, 10.4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 5, Cross-Chapter Box 7, Cross-Chapter Box 12}  

The  literature  identifies  a  broad  set  of  enabling  conditions  that  can  both  foster  shifting 
development pathways and accelerated mitigation, along five categories. (medium evidence, high 
agreement). Policy integration is a necessary component of shifting development pathways, addressing 
multiple objectives. To this aim, mobilising a range of policies is preferable to single policy instruments 
(robust  evidence,  high  agreement).  Governance  for  climate  mitigation  and  shifting  development 
pathways  is  enhanced  when  tailored  to  national  and  local  contexts.  Improved  institutions  and 
governance enable ambitious climate action and help bridge implementation gaps (medium evidence, 
high agreement). Given that strengthening institutions may be a long term endeavour, it needs attention 
in  the  near-term.  Accelerated  mitigation  and  shifting  development  pathways  necessitates  both  re-
directing existing financial flows from high- to low-emissions technologies and systems and to provide 
additional  resources  to  overcome  current  financial  barriers.  (robust  evidence,  high  agreement). 
Opportunities exist in the near-term to close the finance gap. At the national level, public finance for 
actions promoting the SDG agenda helps broaden the scope of mitigation (medium evidence, medium 
agreement).  Changes  in  behaviour  and  lifestyles  are  important  to  move  beyond  mitigation  as 
incremental  change,  and  when  supporting  shifts  to  more  sustainable  development  pathways  will 
broadening the scope of mitigation (medium evidence, medium agreement). The direction of innovation 
matters (robust evidence, high agreement) . The necessary transformational changes are likely to be 
more acceptable if rooted in the development aspirations of the economy and society within which they 
take place. {4.4.1, 4.4.1.2, 4.4.1.3, 4.4.1.4, 4.4.1.5, 4.4.1.6, Figure 4.8, 15.2.2} 

Equity can be an important enabler of deeper ambition for accelerated mitigation, dealing with 
the distribution of costs and benefits and how these are shared as per social contracts, national policy 
and  international  agreements.  Transition  pathways  have  distributional  consequences  such  as  large 
changes in employment and economic structure (robust evidence, high agreement). In that regard, the 
just transition concept has become an international focal point tying together social movements, trade 
unions, and other key stakeholders to ensure equity is better accounted for in low-carbon transitions . 
Effectiveness  of  cooperative  action  and  the  perception  of  fairness  of  such  arrangements  are  closely 
related, in that pathways that prioritise equity and allow broad stakeholders participation can enable 
broader  consensus  for  the  transformational  change  implied  by  deeper  mitigation  efforts  (robust 
evidence, medium agreement). Hence, equity is a concept that is instrumentally important. {4.5, Figure 
4.9} 

In sum, this Chapter suggests that the immediate tasks are to broaden and deepen mitigation in 
the near-term if the global community is to deliver emission reductions at the scale required to keep 
temperature  well  below  2°C  and  pursue  efforts  at  1.5°C.  Deepening  mitigation  means  more  rapid 
decarbonisation. Shifting development pathways to increased sustainability (SDPS) broadens the scope 
of mitigation. Putting the enabling conditions above in place supports both. Depending on context, some 
enabling conditions such as shifting behaviour may take time to establish, underscoring the importance 
of early action. Other enabling conditions, such as improved access to financing, can be put in place in 
a relatively short time frame, and can yield results rapidly.

Accelerating mitigation: The literature points to well-understood policy measures and technologies 
for  accelerating  mitigation,  though  the  balance  depends  on  country  specificities:  1)  decarbonising 
electricity supply to produce net zero CO2, including renewable energy, 2) radically more efficient use 
of energy than today; 3) electrification of end-uses including transport; 4) dramatically lower use of 
fossil fuels than today; 5) converting other uses to low- or zero-carbon fuels (e.g., hydrogen, bioenergy, 
ammonia) in hard-to-decarbonise sectors; 6) promote bioenergy, demand reduction, dietary changes, 
and policies, incentives, and rules for mitigation in the land sector; 7) setting and meeting ambitious 
targets to reduce methane and other short-lived climate forcers. Charting just transitions to net zero may 
provide a vision, which policy measures can help achieve. Though there is increasing experience with 
pricing carbon directly or indirectly, decision-makers might consider a broader toolbox of enablers and 
levers that is available in domains that have not traditionally been climate policy. {4.5, Annex II Part 
IV Section 11} 

Broadening opportunities by focusing on development pathways and considering how to shift them: 
Some of the policy measures may yield rapid results, whereas other, larger transformations may take 
longer. If we are to overcome obstacles, a near-term priority is to put in place the enabling conditions 
to  shifting  development  pathways  to  increased  sustainability.  Learning  from  the  examples  above, 
focusing  on  SDPS  also  provides  a  broader  set  of  tools  to  accelerating  mitigation  and  achieve  other 
sustainable development goals. Consider climate whenever you make choices about development, and 
vice versa. {4.4.1}

4.1  Introduction 

The recent IPCC Report on Global Warming of 1.5C (SR15) made clear that the next three decades 
are critical if we are to achieve the long-term mitigation goal of the Paris Agreement (IPCC 2018a). 
The  present  Chapter  assesses  the  literature  on  mitigation  and  development  pathways  over  that 
timeframe, in the near- (up to 2030) and mid-term (up to 2050).  

It considers three questions: (1) Where are we heading now? That is, what is the current state of affairs 
with respect to climate mitigation and how did we get here? (2) Where do we want to go? I.e., what 
state  of  affairs  would  meet  the  objectives  of  the  Paris  Agreement  and  achieving  the  Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs)? and (3) How do we bring about this shift? I.e., what interventions are at 
societies’ disposal to bring about the necessary change in an equitable manner? 

Where  are  we  heading  now?  Despite  the  drop  in  emissions  due  to  the  COVID-19  crisis,  the  gap 
between  projected  emissions  based  on  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  (NDCs)  in  2030  and 
emissions pathways compatible with the long term temperature goal set in the Paris Agreement remains 
large (4.2.2). In addition to this persistent emissions gap, we face an implementation gap, as current 
policies are insufficient to achieve mitigation targets in NDCs, and sufficient international support is 
not yet available to developing countries who have requested and quantified support needs. Continuing 
along a development pathway characterized by the same underlying drivers, structural obstacles and 
insufficient  enabling  conditions  that  led  to  high  emissions  will  not  address  the  problem  (robust 
evidence, high agreement). 

The analysis of the gap is conducted together with Chapter 3 (see Cross-Chapter Box 4). Chapter 3 is 
working backward, assessing mitigation in the long-term (beyond 2050 up to 2100) to draw the near- 
and mid-term implications of long-term temperature and mitigations goals. Chapter 4, on the other hand, 
works forward from current and planned mitigation (including NDCs) (4.2.1, 4.2.2) and from current 
development  paths  to  assess  the  implications  for  near-  and  mid-term  Greenhouse  Gases  (GHG) 
emissions and development goals. Some countries, regions, cities, communities and non-state actors are 
taking leadership in implementing more ambitious action (4.2.3). This chapter also assesses national 
low emission development strategies (4.2.4). 

Where do we want to go? Technical alternatives and policy options exist to bridge the emissions and 
implementation  gaps,  and  the  literature  illustrates  these  with  a  wide  range  of  accelerated  techno-
economic  pathways  that  deepen  decarbonisation  closer  to  the  pace  and  scale  required  (4.2.5),  and 
examines their impacts on other development objectives (4.2.6). In practice, however, scaling up at the 
broader,  deeper,  and  faster  level  required to meet  climate  goals  while  advancing  other  development 
objectives  regularly  faces  prohibitive  obstacles  (4.2.7).  Mitigation  policies  grafted  on  to  existing 
development pathways are unlikely to achieve rapid and deep emission reductions.  

Secondly,  even  if  carefully  designed,  climate  policies  to  accelerate  mitigation  may  have  adverse 
consequences for other development objectives. As a complement to mitigation action, taking action to 
shift  development  pathways  towards  sustainability  broadens  the  range  of  mitigation  options,  while 
increasing the possibility to meet other development priorities at the same time (medium evidence, high 
agreement). 

Development pathways and shifting them to increased sustainability are introduced in Chapter 1, and 
constitute  a  thread  throughout  the  report  (see  glossary  entry  on  development  pathways).  The  WGII 
Report highlights the related concept of climate resilient development pathways (Chapter 18). Cross-
Chapter Box 5 on shifting sustainable pathway towards sustainability elaborates on the concept. The 
influence  of  development pathways  on  emissions  and  mitigative  capacity  is  discussed  in  Chapter  2. 
Chapter 3 assesses modelling of shifts in development pathways, illustrated by the illustrative mitigation 
pathway called “shifting pathways”. The importance of behavioural change as societies make decisions

that  intentionally  shift  their  future  development  pathway  is  emphasized  in  Chapter  5.  The  systems 
Chapters (6-12) take sectoral perspectives, while pathways that are sustainable are the specific focus of 
Chapter 17. 

How can one shift development pathway and accelerate mitigation? The literature does not provide 
a  complete  handbook  for  shifting  development  pathways  and  accelerating  mitigation.  The  literature 
does, however, shed light on some of the underlying dynamics. Shifting development pathways can be 
necessitated by the existence of pervasive obstacles that prove prohibitive to reaching mitigation and 
other  development  objectives  (4.2.7).  Deliberate  measures  taken  to  facilitate  the  shifting  of 
development pathways and accelerated mitigation involve putting in place key enabling conditions that 
help  overcome  those  obstacles  (see  Figure  4.6)—improving  governance  and  institutional  capacity, 
fostering  behavioural  change  and  technological  innovation,  designing  and  implementing  adequate 
policy, and  finance.  Just transitions,  while  they  will differ  by  context,  are critical to  identifying  and 
avoiding or addressing inequitable distributive consequences (robust evidence, high agreement). 

Enabling conditions necessary to accelerate mitigation and shift development pathways are discussed 
in depth in Chapters 5, 13, 14, 15 and 16. In addition, Chapters 13 and 14 detail the policy instruments 
that  could  help  shift  development  pathways  and  accelerate  the  scale  and  pace  of  mitigation,  while 
Chapter 4 describes those in broad strategies terms. Chapter 13 adds more texture on institutional and 
governance  machinery;  policy  choice,  design  and  implementation;  as  well  as  policy  formulation 
processes, actors and structure across scales. 

Since development pathways and mitigation options depend to large extent on national objectives and 
circumstances, this chapter is primarily concerned with literature at national level (or in the case of the 
European  Union,  at  regional  level),  while  Chapter  3  is  primarily  concerned  with  literature  at  global 
scale.  The  national  scale  selected  in  this  Chapter  requires  attention  as  national  mitigation  pathways 
cannot be linked directly to global mitigation goals (see Box 4.2). This chapter is also concerned mostly 
with economy-wide development and mitigation pathways, as distinct from detailed sectoral work that 
is assessed in  the  systems chapters  6  to 12.  The  present chapter  also  assesses  literature  on  non-state 
action. 

Chapter  4  draws  on  five  major  strands  of  literature:  (1)  an  emerging  literature  on  development 
pathways—conceptual, empirical, and model-based, including at the national and sub-national scales; 
(2)  a  rapidly  expanding,  model-based,  literature  on  mitigation  pathways  in  the  near-  and  mid-term 
(Lepault and Lecocq 2021); (3) studies of NDCs and mid-century strategies; (4) a broader literature on 
transformation and shifts in development pathways, including from non-climate literatures; and (5) a 
significant literature on equity, including just transitions. This is supported by a database of country-
level mitigation scenarios at country level assembled for the preparation of this Chapter (Annex  III, 
Table I.10 and I.11). 

The Chapter builds on past IPCC reports. In AR5, all mitigation pathways were assessed in a single 
chapter  (Clarke  et  al.  2014),  which  focused  mostly  on  the  long-term.  SR1.5  included  a  chapter  on 
mitigation pathways compatible with the temperature goal in the Paris Agreement (Rogelj et al. 2018a), 
mostly at the global level. It also considered strengthening mitigation (de Coninck et al. 2018) in the 
context of poverty, inequality and sustainable development (Roy et al. 2018). Development pathways 
have also been explored, albeit less frequently, in past IPCC reports starting with the Special Report on 
Emissions  Scenarios  (Nakicenovic  et  al.  2000).  Some  early  framing  of  development  pathways  was 
included in the Third Assessment Report (William R. Moomaw et al. 2001), further developed in the 
Fourth Assessment Report (Sathaye et al. 2007). An extended discussion of climate change and equity 
was conducted in AR5 (Fleurbaey et al. 2014).

Chapter 4 examines mitigation within the broader context of development pathways, and examines how 
shifting  development  pathways  can  have  a  major  impact  on  mitigative  capacity  and  broadening 
mitigation options. It is organized as follows. 

Section 4.2 demonstrates that collective mitigation actions fall short of pathways that keep in reach the 
Paris  temperature  goals  in  the  long-term.  Section  4.3  introduces  development  pathways  (given  its 
relative novelty in IPCC assessments), considers the implications of mitigation for development and 
vice  versa,  and  articulates  an  approach  on  both  accelerating  mitigation  and  shifting  development 
pathways. 

Section 4.4 discusses how to shift development pathway and accelerate the scale and pace of mitigation, 
what levers  are  available to  policy makers,  and  how policies may intersect  with  adaptation  goals.  It 
points  out  that  development  pathways  also  drive  adaptation  and  adaptative  capacity,  and  discusses 
various risks associated with shifting development pathways and accelerated mitigation strategies.  

Finally,  equity  and  just  transitions  are  recurring  themes  in  the  Chapter,  specifically  in  relation  to 
accelerating  mitigation  and  shifting  development  pathways  toward  sustainability.  In  section  4.2.2.7, 
equity is discussed in the context of Parties’ assertions regarding the fairness of their NDCs, alongside 
reflections from academic scholarship on the ethical underpinnings of these assertions and of various 
quantitative  analyses  of  equitable  effort-sharing.  Section  4.2.6  discusses  certain  distributional 
implications of domestic mitigation efforts, such as shifts in employment. Sections 4.2.7 and 4.3 note 
the  relevance  of  potential  distributional  impacts  as  an  obstacle  to  climate  action,  as  well  as  the 
inequitable  distribution  of  decision-making  authority.  Finally,  section  4.5  recognizes  the  structural 
relationship between equity and climate, explores just transitions as an international focal point tying 
together  social  movements,  trade  unions,  and  other  stakeholders,  and  thus  an  instrumental  role  in 
establishing consensus. 

 

4.2  Accelerating mitigation actions across scales  

4.2.1  Mitigation targets and measures in nationally determined contributions 

A central instrument of the Paris Agreement is the NDCs, submitted by each country, and reflecting 
national efforts to reduce GHG emissions and build resilience to the impacts of climate change. Every 
five  years,  collective  progress  will  be  compared  against  long-term  goals  of  the  Paris  Agreement. 
Considering  the  outcome  of  a  global  stocktake,  countries  will  prepare  subsequent  NDCs,  showing 
progression in their ambition and enhancing international cooperation (UNFCCC 2015a). 

Prior  to  COP21,  in  2015,  most  countries  submitted  their  INDCs  (Intended  Nationally  Determined 
Contributions),  which  included  mitigation  targets  for  2025  or  2030.  INDCs  become  first  NDCs  on 
ratification  and/or  after  national  governments’  revision,  and  by  11  October  2021,  the  official  NDC 
registry  contained  194  first  NDCs  with  105  new  and  updated  NDCs  from  132  Parties  to  the  Paris 
Agreement, covering 53% of the total global emissions in 2019 of 52.4 GtCO2-eq without LULUCF, 
and  13  second  NDCs.  Most  of  the  Parties  that  submitted  new  or  updated  NDCs  have  demonstrated 
increased ambition in addressing climate change. Moreover, though some countries like China have not 
submitted their updated NDCs yet, they have already announced their updated NDC goals somewhere. 
Countries will take the first stock in 2023 based on their progression towards achieving the objectives 
of Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2015a, 2018a; SB Chairs 2021) (14.3.2.5).  

Submitted NDCs vary in content, scope and background assumptions. First NDCs contain mitigation 
targets, and in many cases also provisions about adaptation. The mitigation targets range from economy-
wide absolute emission reduction targets to strategies, plans and actions for low-emission development. 
Baseline years vary from 1990 to 2015 and in almost all NDCs the targeted time frame is 2030, with a

few specified periods of until 2025, 2035, 2040 or 2050. Around 43% of the mitigation targets in first 
NDCs are expressed in terms of deviation below business-as-usual by a specified target year, either for 
the  whole  economy  or  for  specific  sectors,  while  around  35%  include  fixed-level  targets  (either 
reductions or limitations compared to base years), and another 22% refer to intensity targets (in terms 
of  GHG,  CO2  or  energy)  or  policies  and  measures,  with an increasing  number  of  Parties moving to 
absolute  emission  reduction  targets  in  their  new  or  updated  NDCs  (UNFCCC  2016a,  2021).  Some 
developing countries’ NDCs include unconditional elements, while others include conditional ones, the 
latter  with  higher  ambition  if  finance,  technology  and  capacity  building  support  from  developed 
countries  is  provided  (UNFCCC  2016a).2  In  some  NDCs,  the  additional  mitigation  is  quantified,  in 
others not (Figure 14.2). 

Most first NDCs cover all specific sectors, including LULUCF, and communicate specific targets for 
individual sub-sectors to support their overall mitigation targets. Concrete actions and priority areas are 
more detailed in the energy sector, with increased share of renewable energies and energy efficiency 
being  highlighted  in  the  majority  of  NDCs.  Given  the  uncertainty  behind  LULUCF  emission  and 
removal accounting (Grassi et al. 2017; Jian et al. 2019), several countries state that their accounting 
framework will only be defined in later NDCs. The GHG included and the global warming potentials 
(GWPs)  used  to  aggregate  emissions  also  vary  across  NDCs.  Most  countries  only  refer  to  carbon 
dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions aggregated based on IPCC AR2 or AR4 metrics, while 
few NDCs also include fluorinated gases and use IPCC AR5 GWPs. The shares of Parties that indicate 
possible use of at least one type of voluntary cooperation and set qualitative limits on their use  have 
both nearly doubled in new or updated NDCs. 

There  is  considerable  literature  on  country-level  mitigation  pathways,  including  but  not  limited  to 
NDCs.  Country  distribution  of  this  literature  is  very  unequal  (robust  evidence,  high  agreement).  In 
particular,  there  is  a  growing  literature  on  (I)NDCs,  with  a  wide  scope  which  includes  estimate  of 
emissions levels of NDCs (see section 4.2.2.2); alignment with sustainable development goals (Caetano 
et al. 2020; Campagnolo and Davide 2019; Fuso Nerini et al. 2019; Antwi-Agyei et al. 2018); ambition 
(Höhne  et  al.  2018;  Vogt-Schilb  and  Hallegatte  2017;  Hermwille  et  al.  2019);  energy  development 
(Scott et al. 2018); and the legality of downgrading NDCs (Rajamani and Brunnée 2017). Other studies 
note that many NDCs contain single-year mitigation targets, and suggest that a multi-year trajectory is 
important for more rigorous monitoring (Elliott et al. 2017; Dagnet et al. 2017). 

The literature also points out that beyond the ‘headline numbers’, information in (I)NDCs is difficult to 
analyse  (Pauw  et  al.  2018).  Information  for  ‘clarity,  transparency  and  understanding’  is  to  be 
communicated  with  NDCs,  although  initial  guidance  was  not  specific  (UNFCCC  2014).  While  the 
adoption of the Paris rule-book provided some greater specificity (UNFCCC 2018b,c), the information 
included  in  the  NDCs  remains  uneven.  Many  NDCs  omit  important  mitigation  sectors  and  do  not 
adequately provide details on costs and financing of implementation (Pauw et al. 2018). Countries are 
also invited to explain how their NDCs are fair and ambitious, though the way this has been done so far 
has been criticised as insufficiently rigorous (Winkler et al. 2018). 

 

 
FOOTNOTE2 “Unconditional” NDCs refer to abatement efforts pledged without any conditions (this terminology is used by 
the literature, not by the Paris Agreement). They are based mainly on domestic abatement actions, although countries can use 
international cooperation to meet their targets. (2) “Conditional” NDCs require international cooperation, for example bilateral 
agreements under article 6, financing or monetary and/or technological transfers (14.3.2).

4.2.2  Aggregate  effects  of  NDCs  and  other  mitigation  efforts  relative  to  long-term 

mitigation pathways 

Introduction 

4.2.2.1 
Near-term  mitigation  targets  submitted  as  part  of  NDCs  to  the  UNFCCC,  as  well  as  currently 
implemented policies, provide a basis for assessing potential emissions levels up to 2030 at the national, 
regional  and  global  level.  The  following  sections  present  an  evaluation  of  the  methods  used  for 
assessing  projected  emissions  under  NDCs  and  current  policies  (4.2.2.2),  and  the  results  of  these 
assessments at global, regional and national level assessing a broad available literature based on first 
NDC submissions from 2015/16 and pre-COVID economic projections (4.2.2.3). The impacts of the 
COVID-19 pandemic and related government responses on emissions projections are then discussed in 
4.2.2.4 and the  implications  of  updated  NDCs  submitted in 2020/21  on  emissions  follow  in  4.2.2.5. 
Section  0  presents  an  assessment  of  the  so-called  “implementation  gap”  between  what  currently 
implemented  policies  are  expected  to  deliver  and  what  the  ambitions  laid  out  under  the  full 
implementation  of  the  NDCs  are  projected  to  achieve.  Finally,  a  comparison  of  ambitions  across 
different  countries  or  regions  (4.2.2.7)  is  presented  and  the  uncertainties  of  projected  emissions 
associated with NDCs and current policies are estimated, including a discussion of measures to reduce 
uncertainties in the specification of NDCs (4.2.2.8). 

The  literature  reviewed  in  this  section  includes  globally  comprehensive  assessments  of  NDCs  and 
current policies, both peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed (but not unpublished model results) as well 
as synthesis reports by the UNFCCC Secretariat, government reports and national studies. 

The  aggregate  effects  of  NDCs  provide  information  on  where  emissions  might  be  in  2025/2030, 
working forward from their recent levels. Chapter 3 of this report works backwards from temperature 
goals, defining a range of long-term global pathways consistent with 1.5°C, 2°C and higher temperature 
levels. By considering the two together, it is possible to assess whether NDCs are collectively consistent 
with 1.5°C, 2°C and other temperature pathways (Cross-Chapter Box 4, p.4-22). 

4.2.2.2  Methods to project emissions under NDCs and current policies 
A variety of different methods are used to assess emissions implications of NDCs and current policies 
over the time horizon to 2025 or 2030. Some of these projections were explicitly submitted as part of 
an  official communication to  UNFCCC  (e.g.,  Biennial  Report,  Biennial  Update Reports  or  National 
Communications) while the majority is from independent studies. 

Methods that are used in independent studies (but that can also underlie the official communications) 
can broadly be separated into two groups, 

(i) 

(ii) 

system modelling studies which analyse policies and targets in a comprehensive modelling 
framework such an integrated assessment, energy systems or integrated land-use model to 
project emissions (or other indicators) of mitigation targets in NDCs and current policies, 
either at the national or global scale (noting some differences in the systems), and 

hybrid  approaches  that  typically  start  out  with  emissions  pathways  as  assessed by  other 
published studies (e.g., the IEA World Energy Outlook, national emissions pathways such 
as those specified in some NDCs) and use these directly or apply additional modifications 
to them. 

System modelling studies are conducted at global, regional and national scales. Global models provide 
an  overview,  are  necessary  for  assessment  of  global  phenomena  (e.g.,  temperature  change),  can 
integrate climate models and trade effects. National models typically include more details on sectors, 
technology,  behaviour  and  intersectoral  linkages,  but  often  use  simplifying  assumptions  for 
international trade (e.g., the Armington elasticity approach). Critically, they can also better reflect local 
socio-economic and political conditions and their evolution (i.e., national development pathways). A

variety of modelling paradigms are found, including optimisation and simulation models, myopic and 
with foresight, monolithic and modular (see Annex III: Scenarios and modelling methods). 

Among the hybrid approaches, three broader categories can be distinguished, (i) direct use of official 
emission projection as part of submitted NDC or other communication to UNFCCC, (ii) historical trend 
extrapolation  of  emissions  based  on  inventory  data,  possibly  disaggregated  by  sector  and  emission 
species, and (iii) use of Reference/Business-As-Usual pathways from an independent published study 
(e.g.,  IEA  WEO).  In  all  cases,  the  reductions  are  then  estimated  on  top  of  the  resulting  emission 
trajectory.  Note  that  globally  comprehensive  studies  may  vary  the  approach  used  depending  on  the 
country. 

Beyond the method applied, studies also differ in a number of dimensions, including (i) their spatial 
resolution and coverage, (ii) their sectoral resolution and coverage, (iii) the GHGs that are included in 
the assessment, the GWPs (or other metrics) to aggregate them, the emissions inventory (official vs. 
independent  inventory  data)  and  related  accounting  approaches  used  as  a  starting  point  for  the 
projections, (iv) the set of scenarios analysed (Reference/Business-As-Usual, Current Policies, NDCs, 
etc.),  and  (v)  the  degree  to  which  individual  policies  and  their  impact  on  emissions  are  explicitly 
represented (Table 4.1). 

First, the studies are relevant to different spatial levels, ranging from macro-scale regions with globally 
comprehensive coverage to national level (4.2.2.3) and subnational and company level in a few cases 
(4.2.3).  It  is  important  to  recognise  that  globally  comprehensive  studies  typically  resolve  a  limited 
number of countries individually, in particular those that contribute a high share to global emissions, 
but  have  poor  resolution  of  remaining  countries  or  regions,  which  are  assessed  in  aggregate  terms. 
Conversely, studies with high resolution of a particular country tend to treat interactions with the global 
scale in a limited way. The recent literature includes attempts to provide a composite global picture 
from  detailed  national  studies  (Bataille  et  al.  2016a;  Deep  Decarbonization  Pathways  Project  2015; 
Roelfsema et al. 2020). 

A second dimension in which the studies are different is their comprehensiveness of covering different 
emitting sectors. Some studies focus on the contribution of a single sector, for example the Agriculture, 
Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector (Fyson and Jeffery 2019; Grassi et al. 2017) or the energy 
system (including both energy supply and demand sectors), to emission reductions as specified in the 
NDC. Such studies give an indication of the importance of a given sector to achieving the NDC target 
of a country and can be used as a benchmark to compare to comprehensive studies, but adding sectoral 
contributions up represents a methodological challenge. 

Third,  GHG  coverage  is  different  across  studies.  Some  focus  on  CO2  only,  while  others  take  into 
account the full suite of Kyoto gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6, see glossary). For the latter, 
different metrics for aggregating GHGs to a CO2-equivalent metric are being used, typically GWP 100 
from different IPCC assessments (Table 4.1) 

Fourth, studies typically cover a set of scenarios, though how these scenarios are defined varies widely. 
The literature reporting IAM results often includes Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which 
are officially communicated, and Current Policies (CP) as interpreted by modellers. Studies based on 
national modelling, by contrast, tend to define scenarios reflecting very different national contexts. In 
both cases, modellers typically include so-called No Policy Baseline scenarios (alternatively referred to 
as Reference or Business-as-Usual scenarios) which do not necessarily reflect currently implemented 
policies and thus are not assessed as reference pathways (see section 4.2.6.1). There are also various 
approaches  to  considering  more  ambitious  action  compared  to  the  CP  or  NDC  projections  that  are 
covered in addition. 

Fifth, studies differ in the way they represent policies (current or envisioned in NDCs), depending on 
their  internal  structure.  For  example,  a  subsidy  to  energy  efficiency  in  buildings  may  be  explicitly

modelled (e.g., in a sectoral model that represents household decisions relative to building insulation), 
represented by a proxy (e.g., by an exogenous decrease in the discount rate households use to make 
choices), or captured by its estimated outcome (e.g., by an exogenous decrease in the household demand 
for energy, say in an energy system model or in a compact CGE). Detailed representations (such as the 
former example) do not necessarily yield more accurate results than compact ones (the latter example), 
but the set of assumptions that are necessary to represent the same policy will be very different. 

Finally, policy coverage strongly varies across studies with some just implementing high level targets 
specified in policy documents and NDCs while others represent the policies with the largest impact on 
emissions and some looking at very detailed measures and policies at subnational level. In addition, in 
countries  with  rapidly  evolving  policy  environments,  slightly  different  cut-off  dates  for  the  policies 
considered in an emission projection can make a significant difference for the results  (Dubash et al. 
2018). 

The challenges described above are dealt with in the assessment of quantitative results in Section 4.2.2.3 
by (i) comparing national studies with country-level results from global studies to understand systematic 
biases,  (ii)  comparing  economy-wide emissions  (incl. AFOLU)  as  well  as energy-related emissions, 
(iii) using different emission metrics including CO2 and Kyoto GHG emissions where the latter have 
been  harmonized  to  using  AR6  GWP100  metrics,  and  (iv)  tracking  cut-off  dates  of  implemented 
policies  and  NDCs  used  in  different  references  (Table  S4.1).  The  most  notable  differences  in 
quantitative emission estimates related to current policies and NDCs relate to the COVID-19 pandemic 
and its implications and to the updated NDCs mostly submitted since early 2020 which are separately 
dealt with in Sections 4.2.2.4 and 4.2.2.5, respectively. 

In addition to assessing the emissions outcomes of NDCs, some studies report development indicators, 
by which they mean a wide diversity of socio-economic indicators (Altieri et al. 2016; Jiang et al. 2013; 
Benavides et al. 2015; Chai and Xu 2014; Delgado et al. 2014; La Rovere et al. 2014a; Paladugula et 
al. 2018; Parikh et al. 2018; Zevallos et al. 2014; Zou et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2021; Bataille et al. 2016a), 
share  of  low-carbon  energy  (Bertram  et  al.  2015;  Riahi  et  al.  2015),  renewable  energy  deployment 
(Roelfsema  et  al.  2018),  production  of  fossil  fuels  (SEI  et  al.  2020)  or  investments into low-carbon 
mitigation measures (McCollum et al. 2018) to track progress towards long-term temperature goals. 

4.2.2.3  Projected emissions under NDCs and current policies by 2025/2030 
The emissions projections presented in this section relate to the first NDCs, as communicated in 2015 
and 2016, and on which an extensive literature exists. New and updated NDCs, mostly submitted since 
the beginning of 2020, are dealt with in Section 4.2.2.5. Similarly, the implications of COVID-19 and 
the related government responses on emissions projections is specifically dealt with in Section 4.2.2.4. 

Table 4.1 presents the evidence base for the assessment of projected emissions of original NDCs and 
current policies until 2030. It covers 31 countries and regions responsible for about 82% of global GHG 
emission (excluding FOLU CO2 emissions) and draws quantitative estimates from more than 40 studies 
(see  Table  S4.1  in  the  Supplementary  Material  to  Chapter  4).  The table  allows comparing  emission 
projections from national and globally comprehensive studies as well as official communications by 
countries to the UNFCCC at the national/regional level. The global aggregates presented in Table 4.1 
derive  from  globally  comprehensive  studies  only  and  are  not  the  result  of  aggregating  country 
projections  up  to the  global level.  As  different  studies  report different emission indicators, the  table 
includes four different indicators: CO2 and GHG emissions, in- or excluding AFOLU emissions. Where 
possible, multiple indicators are included per study. 

Globally comprehensive studies.  

The UNFCCC Secretariat has assessed the aggregate effect of NDCs  multiple times. The first report 
considered the intended NDCs in relation to 2°C  (UNFCCC 2015b), whereas the second considered 
NDCs also in relation to 1.5°C (UNFCCC 2016b). New submissions and updates of NDCs in 2020/21

are assessed in Section 4.2.2.5. A number of globally comprehensive studies (den Elzen et al. 2016; 
Luderer et al. 2016; Rogelj et al. 2016, 2017; Vandyck et al. 2016; Rose et al. 2017; Baumstark et al. 
2021) which estimate aggregate emissions outcomes of NDCs and current policies have previously been 
assessed in Cross-Chapter-Box 11 of IPCC SR1.5. 

According to the assessment in this report, studies projecting emissions of current policies based on 
pre-COVID assumptions lead to median global GHG emissions of 60 GtCO2-eq with a full range of 54-
68 by 2030 and original unconditional and conditional NDCs submitted in 2015/16 to 57 (49-63) and 
54  (50-60)  GtCO2-eq,  respectively  (robust  evidence,  medium  agreement)  (Table  4.1).  Globally 
comprehensive and national-level studies project emissions of current policies and NDCs to 2025 and 
2030 and, in general, are in good agreement about projected emissions at the country level. 

These  estimates  are  close  to  the  ones  provided  by  the  IPCC  SR1.5,  Cross-Chapter-Box  11,  and  the 
UNEP emissions gap report (UNEP 2020a)3. 

National studies 
A  large  body  of  literature  on  national  and  regional  emissions  projections,  including  official 
communications  of  as  part  of  the  NDC  submissions  and  independent  studies  exist.  A  subset  of  this 
literature provides quantitative estimates for the 2030 timeframe. As highlighted in Section 4.2.1, the 
number of independent  studies  varies considerably across  countries  with an emphasis  on  the largest 
emitting  countries.  This  is  reflected  in  Table  4.1  (see  also  Table  S4.1).  Despite  smaller  differences 
between  globally  comprehensive  and  national  studies  for  a  few  countries,  there  is  generally  good 
agreement between the different types of studies, providing evidence that these quantitative estimates 
are fairly robust. 

Sectoral studies 
Sectoral studies are essential to understand the contributions of concrete measures of NDCs and current 
policies.  For  example,  approximately  98%  of  NDCs  include  the  energy  sector  in  their  mitigation 
contributions, of which nearly 50% include a specific target for the share of renewables, and about 5% 
aim at increasing nuclear energy production (Stephan et al. 2016). Transport is covered explicitly in 
75% of NDCs, although specific targets for the sector exist in only 21% of NDCs (PPMC and SLoCaT 
2016). Measures or targets for buildings are referred to explicitly in 27% of NDCs (GIZ 2017). 36% of 
NDCs  include  targets  or  actions  that  are  specific  to  the  agriculture  sector  (FAO  2016).  LULUCF 
(mitigation) is included in 80 % of all submitted NDCs, while 59 % include adaptation and 29 % refer 
to REDD+. 

Greater sectoral expertise and involvement will be critical to accomplishing development and climate 
goals due to enhanced availability of information and expertise on specific sectoral options, greater ease 
of  aligning  the  NDCs  with  sectoral  strategies,  and  greater  awareness  among  sector-level  decision-
makers  and  stakeholders  (NDC  Partnership  2017;  Fekete  et  al.  2015).  Sector-specific  studies  are 
assessed in the sectoral Chapters (6-11) of this report.

 

 
FOOTNOTE3 Note that the statistical metrics reported are slightly different across the reports. For example, IPCC 
SR1.5 reported the 25th to 75th range while the UNEP emissions gap report uses median and 10th to 90th percentile 
ranges. In addition, this report applies 100-year GWPs from AR6 to aggregate across different GHG emission 
species, whereas 100-year GWPs from AR4 were applied in IPCC SR1.5 and UNEP 2020. The application of 
AR6 GWPs on average leads to increase of estimates by about 1.3% and ranges are wider due to the difference in 
statistical error metrics.

Table 4.1 Assessment of projected 2030 emissions of current policies based on pre-COVID assumptions and original NDCs submitted in 2015/16 for 28 individual 

countries/regions and the world. The table compares projected emissions from globally comprehensive studies, national studies and, when available, official 

communications to UNFCCC using different emission sources (fossil fuels, AFOLU sector) and different emission metrics (CO 2, Kyoto GHGs). The comparison 

allows identifying potential biases across the ranges and median estimates projected by the different sets of studies.

first NDC submitted prior to the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, but not including the updated NDC submitted following its re-entry. i The EU estimates are based on 
the 28 member states up until 31 January 2020, i.e. including the UK.

4.2.2.4  Estimated impact of COVID-19 and governmental responses on emissions projections 
The  impacts  of  COVID-19  and  national  governments’  economic  recovery  measures  on  current  (see 
2.2.2) and projected emissions of individual countries and globally under current policies scenarios until 
2030  may  be  significant,  although  estimates  are  highly  uncertain  and  vary  across  the  few  available 
studies.  The analyses  published to  date  (October 2021)  are  based  on limited information about  how 
COVID-19 has affected the economy and hence GHG emissions across countries so far in 2020, and 
also based on assumptions about COVID-19’s longer term impact. Moreover, the comparison of pre- 
and post-COVID-19 projections captures the impact of COVID-19 as well as other factors such as the 
consideration of recently adopted policies not related to COVID-19, as well as methodological changes. 

Across different studies (Kikstra et al. 2021; IEA 2020; Dafnomilis et al. 2021; Pollitt et al. 2021; UNEP 
2020a; Climate Action Tracker 2020; Keramidas et al. 2021; Dafnomilis et al. 2020), the impact of the 
general slowdown of the economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated policy responses 
would lead to a reduced estimate of global GHG emissions in 2030 of about 1 to 5 GtCO2eq, equivalent 
to 1.5 to 8.5 per cent, compared to the pre-COVID-19 estimates (see Table S4.2 for details). Nascimento 
et al. (2021) analyse the impacts of COVID-19 on current policy emission projections for 26 countries 
and regions and find a large range of emission reduction—between -1% and -21%—across these.  

As indicated by a growing number of studies at the national and global level, how large near- to mid-
term emissions implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are to a large degree depends on how stimulus 
or recovery packages are designed (Wang et al. 2020; Gillingham et al. 2020; Forster et al. 2020; Malliet 
et al. 2020; Le Quéré et al. 2020; Obergassel et al. 2021; IEA 2020; UNEP 2020a; Pollitt et al. 2021).  

Four studies (Climate Action Tracker 2021; den Elzen et al. 2021; JRC 2021; Riahi et al. 2021) provide 
an  update  of  the  current  policies  assessment presented  in  Section  4.2.2.3  by taking  into account the 
effects of COVID-19 as well as potential updates of policies. The resulting GHG emissions in 2030 are 
estimated to be 57 GtCO2-eq with a full range of 52 to 60 GtCO2-eq (Table 4.2). This is a reduction of 
about 3 GtCO2-eq or 5% compared to the pre-COVID estimates from Section 4.2.2.3.

4.2.2.5  Estimated impact of new and updated NDCs on emissions projections 
The number of studies estimating the emissions implications of new and updated NDCs and announced 
mitigation pledges that can be used for the quantitative assessment is limited to four (Table 4.3) (Climate 
Action  Tracker  2021;  den  Elzen  et  al.  2021;  Meinshausen  et  al.  2021;  JRC  2021).  One  other  study 
includes a limited number of NDC updates (Riahi et al. 2021) and another (UNFCCC 2021) excludes 
LULUCF emissions. They are therefore not directly comparable to the other two. In addition, the UNEP

Emissions Gap Report 2021 (UNEP 2021) in itself is assessment of almost the same studies included 
here. The evidence base for the updated NDC assessment is thus considerably smaller compared to that 
of the assessment of emissions implications of original NDCs presented in Section 4.2.2.3. However, it 
is worthwhile to note that the earlier versions of the studies summarized in Table 4.2 and Table 4.3 are 
broadly  representative  for  the  emissions  range  implied  by  the  pre-COVID-19  current  policies  and 
original NDCs of the full set of studies shown in Table 4.1, therefore building confidence in estimates. 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

An additional challenge lies in the fact that these studies do not all apply the same cut-off date for NDC 
updates, potentially leading to larger systematic deviations in the resulting emission estimates. Another 
complication is the fact that publicly announced mitigation pledges on global 2030 emissions that have 
not been officially submitted to the UNFCCC NDC registry yet, have been included in several of the 
studies to anticipate their impact on emission levels (see notes to Table 4.3). In addition to the updates 
of NDC targets, most of the new studies also include impacts of COVID-19 on future emission levels 
(as discussed in 4.2.2.4) which may have led to considerable downward revisions of emission trends 
unrelated to NDCs. Table 4.3 presents the emission estimates of the four studies that form the basis of 
the quantitative assessment presented here and three other studies to compare with.

of 3.8 (3.0-5.3) GtCO2-eq of the central unconditional NDC estimates and of 4.5 (2.7-6.3) GtCO2-eq of 
the central conditional NDC estimate emerges (medium evidence, medium agreement). The emissions 
gaps  between  temperature  limits  and  new  and  updated  NDCs  are  assessed  in  Cross-Chapter  Box  4 
below. New and updated unconditional NDC reduce the median gap with 2°C emissions pathways in 
2030 by slightly more than 20%, from a median gap of 17 GtCO2-eq (9-23) to 13 (10-17). New and 
updated conditional NDC reduce the median gap with 2°C emissions pathways in 2030 by about one 
third, from 14 GtCO2-eq (10-20) to 10 (7-14). New and updated unconditional NDC reduce the median 
gap with 1.5°C emissions pathways in 2030 by about 15%, from a median gap of 27 GtCO2-eq (19-32) 
to  23  GtCO2-eq  (20-26).  New  and  updated  conditional  NDC  reduce  the  median  gap  with  1.5°C 
emissions pathways in 2030 by about 20%, from a median gap of 24 GtCO2-eq (20-29) to 19 GtCO2-
eq (16-24). Box 4.1 discusses the adaptation gap. 

Globally, the implementation gap between projected emissions of current policies and the unconditional 
and conditional new and updated NDCs is estimated to be around 4 and 7 GtCO2eq in 2030, respectively 
(Table 4.2 and 4.3) (medium evidence, medium agreement), with many countries requiring additional 
policies  and  associated  climate  action  to  meet  their  mitigation  targets  as  specified  under  the  NDCs 
(limited evidence) (see 4.2.2.6 for more details). It should be noted that the implementation gap varies 
considerably across countries, with some having policies in place estimated to be sufficient to achieve 
the emission targets their NDCs, some where additional policies may be required to be sufficient, as 
well as differences between the policies in place and action on the ground. 

4.2.2.6  Tracking progress in implementing and achieving NDCs 
Under the Enhanced Transparency Framework, countries will transition from reporting biennial reports 
(BRs) and biennial update reports (BURs) to reporting biennial transparency reports (BTRs) starting, 
at the latest, by December 2024. Each Party will be required to report information necessary to track 
progress made in implementing and achieving its NDC under the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2018b). 
Thus, no official data exists yet on tracking progress of individual NDCs.  

Meanwhile, there is some literature at global and national level that aims at assessing whether countries 
are  on  track  or  progressing  towards  implementing  their  NDCs  and  to  which  degree  the  NDCs 
collectively are sufficient to reach the temperature targets  of the Paris agreement (Quéré et al. 2018; 
Höhne et al. 2018; Roelfsema et al. 2020; Rogelj et al. 2016; den Elzen et al. 2019; Höhne et al. 2020). 
Most of these studies focus on major emitters such as G20 countries and with the aim to inform countries 
to strengthen their ambition regularly, e.g., through progress of NDCs and as part of the global stocktake 
(Höhne et al. 2018; Peters et al. 2017). However, a limited number of studies assess the implementation 
gaps of conditional NDCs in terms of finance, technology and capacity building support. Some authors 
conclude that finance needed to fulfil conditional NDCs exceeds available resources or the current long-
term goal for finance (USD100 billion yr-1) (Pauw et al. 2019); others assess financial resources needed 
for forest-related activities (Kissinger et al. 2019) (15.4.2). The literature suggests that consistent and 
harmonised approach to track progress of countries towards their NDCs would be helpful (den Elzen et 
al.  2019;  Höhne  et  al.  2018;  Peters  et  al.  2017),  and  negotiations  on  a  common  tabular  format  are 
expected to conclude during COP26 in November 2021. 

With  an  implementation  gap  in  2030  of  4  to  7  GtCO2-eq  (4.2.2.5),  many  countries  will  need  to 
implement additional policies to meet their self-determined mitigation targets as specified under the 
NDCs.  Studies  that  assess  the  level  of  projected  emissions  under  current  policies  indicate  that  new 
policies  (that  have  been  implemented  since  the  first  assessment  of  the  NDCs  in  2015  and  are  thus 
covered in more recent projections) have reduced projections, by about 2 GtCO2-eq since the adoption 
of the Paris Agreement in 2015 to 2019 (Climate Action Tracker 2019; UNEP 2020a; den Elzen et al. 
2019).

4.2.2.7  Literature on fairness and ambition of NDCs 
Most countries provided information on how they consider their NDCs to be fair and ambitious in the 
NDCs submitted to UNFCCC and many of these NDCs refer to specific national circumstances such as 
social,  economic  and  geographical  factors  when  outlining  why  they  are  fair  and  ambitious.  Further, 
several Parties provided information on specific criteria for evaluating fairness and ambition, including 
criteria relating to: responsibility and capability; share of emissions; development and/or technological 
capacity; mitigation potential; cost of mitigation actions; the degree of progression or stretching beyond 
the current level of effort; and the link to objectives and global goals (UNFCCC 2016a). 

According to its Article 2.2, the Paris Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle 
of  common  but  differentiated  responsibilities  and  respective  capabilities,  in  the  light  of  different 
national circumstances, the latter clause being new, added to the UNFCCC principle (Rajamani 2017; 
Voigt  and  Ferreira  2016).  Possible  different  interpretations  of  equity  principles  lead  to  different 
assessment frameworks (Lahn 2018; Lahn and Sundqvist 2017). 

Various  assessment  frameworks  have  been  proposed  to  analyse  fair  share  ranges  for  NDCs.  The 
literature on equity frameworks including quantification of national emissions allocation is assessed in 
section 4.5 (see 13.4.2, 14.3.2 and 14.5.3). Recent literature has assessed equity, analysing how fairness 
is expressed in NDCs in a bottom-up manner (Cunliffe et al. 2019; Mbeva and Pauw 2016; Winkler et 
al. 2018). Some studies compare NDC ambition level with different effort sharing regimes and which 
principles are applied to various countries and regions (Robiou du Pont and Meinshausen 2018; Robiou 
Du Pont et al. 2017; Holz et al. 2018; Peters et al. 2015; Pan et al. 2017; van den Berg et al. 2019). 
Others propose multi-dimensional evaluation schemes for NDCs that combine a range of indicators, 
including  the  NDC  targets,  cost-effectiveness  compared  to  global  models,  recent  trends  and  policy 
implementation into consideration (Aldy et al. 2017; Höhne et al. 2018). Yet other literature evaluates 
NDC  ambition  against  factors  such  as  technological  progress  of  energy  efficiency  and  low-carbon 
technologies (Jiang et al. 2017; Wakiyama and Kuramochi 2017; Kuramochi et al.  2017), synergies 
with adaptation plans (Fridahl and Johansson 2017), the obligations to deploy carbon dioxide removal 
technologies like BECCS in the future implied by their near-term emission reductions where they are 
not reflected on in the first NDCs (Fyson et al. 2020; Pozo et al. 2020; Peters and Geden 2017; Mace et 
al.  2021).  Others  identify  possible  risks  of  unfairness  when  applying  GWP*  as  emissions  metric  at 
national scale (Rogelj and Schleussner 2019). A recent study on national fair shares draws on principles 
of  international  environmental  law,  excludes  approaches  based  on  cost  and  grandfathering,  thus 
narrowing the range of national fair shares previously assessed, and apply this to the quantification of 
national fair share emissions targets (Rajamani et al. 2021).  

4.2.2.8  Uncertainty in estimates 
There are many factors that influence the global aggregated effects of NDCs. There is limited literature 
on systematically analysing the impact of uncertainties on the NDC projections with some exception 
(Benveniste  et  al.  2018;  Rogelj  et  al.  2017).  The  UNEP  Gap  Report  (UNEP  2017a)  discusses 
uncertainties of NDC estimates in some detail. The main factors include variations in overall socio-
economic  development;  uncertainties  in  GHG  inventories;  conditionality;  targets  with  ranges  or  for 
single years; accounting of biomass; and different GHG aggregation metrics (e.g., GWP values from 
different IPCC assessments). In addition, when mitigation effort in NDCs is described as measures that 
do only indirectly translate into emission reductions, assumptions necessary for the translation come 
into play (Doelle 2019). For a more elaborate discussion of uncertainties in NDCs see Section 14.3.2. 

Some studies assume successful implementation of all of the NDCs’ proposed  measures, sometimes 
including varying assumptions to account for some of the NDC features which are subject to assumed 
conditions  related  to  finance  and  technology  transfer.  Countries  “shall  pursue  domestic  mitigation 
measures” under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2015c), but they are not legally bound

to the result of reducing emissions (Winkler 2017a). Some authors consider this to be a lack of a strong 
guarantee that mitigation targets in NDCs will be implemented  (Nemet et al. 2017). Others point to 
growing extent of national legislation to provide a legal basis for action (Iacobuta et al. 2018) (13.2). 
These  factors  together  with  incomplete  information  in  NDCs  mean  there  is  uncertainty  about  the 
estimates of anticipated 2030 emission levels. 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

The aggregation of targets results in large uncertainty (Benveniste et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2017). In 
particular, clarity  on the  contributions from  the land use sector  to  NDCs is needed  “to prevent  high 
LULUCF uncertainties from undermining the strength and clarity of mitigation in other sectors” (Fyson 
and Jeffery 2019). Methodological differences in the accounting of the LULUCF anthropogenic CO2 
sink  between  scientific  studies  and  national  GHG  inventories  (as  submitted  to  UNFCCC)  further 
complicate the comparison and aggregation of emissions of NDC implementation (Grassi et al. 2018, 
2021)  (Section  7.2.3  and  Cross-Chapter  Box  6).  This  uncertainty  could  be  reduced  with  clearer 
guidelines for compiling future NDCs, in particular when it comes to mitigation efforts not expressed 
as  absolute  economy-wide  targets  (Doelle  2019),  and  explicit  specification  of  technical  details, 
including energy accounting methods, harmonised emission inventories (Rogelj et al. 2017) and finally, 
increased transparency and comparability (Pauw et al. 2018).

Cross-Chapter  Box  4  Comparison  of  NDCs  and  current  policies  with  the  2030 
GHG emissions from long-term temperature pathways

Introduction 

The Paris Agreement (PA) sets a long-term goal of holding the increase of global average temperature 
to ‘well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels’ and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 
1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. This is underpinned by the ‘aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse 
gas emissions as soon as possible’ and ‘achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources 
and removals by sinks of GHG in the second half of this century’ (UNFCCC 2015d). The PA adopts a 
bottom-up approach in which countries determine their contribution to reach the PA’s long-term goal. 
These national targets, plans and measures are called ‘nationally determined contributions’ or NDCs. 

The NDCs are a central instrument of the PA to achieve its long-term goal. It thus combines a global 
goal with a country-driven (bottom-up) instrument to a hybrid climate policy architecture to strengthen 
the global response to climate change. All signatory countries committed to communicating nationally 
determined contributions including mitigation targets, every five years. While the NDCs mostly state 
targets, countries are also obliged to pursue domestic mitigation measures to achieve the objectives. 
The  literature  examines  the  emissions  outcome  of  the  range  of  policies  implemented  to  reach  these 
targets.

Cross-Chapter Box 4, Figure 1 Aggregate GHG emission outcomes of NDCs and long-term mitigation 

pathways consistent with global temperature limits. Shown are emission ranges that would emerge when 
assuming the full implementation of current unconditional and conditional NDCs (grey bars, median and 

full range) and global pathways from the AR6 scenario database that can be grouped into four types: 
pathways with near-term emissions developments in line with (1) current policies and extended with 

comparable ambition levels beyond 2030; (2) pathways holding warming below 2°C (66% chance) with 
near term emissions developments reflecting ambition levels in current NDCs until 2030; and mitigation 

pathways undertaking immediate action after 2020 towards (3) holding warming below 2°C (66% 

chance) and (4) limiting warming to 1.5°C by 2100 (>50% chance) with no or limited (<0.1°C) overshoot, 
respectively. The upper panel shows the emission pathways until 2050 (median and 25th-75th percentiles) 

with their emissions ranges in 2030 and 2050 broken out in full (median and 5th-95th percentiles). The 

lower panel shows the ranges (25th -75th percentiles) for the four types of emissions pathways over the 21st 

century. 

Notes: GHG emissions are expressed in CO2-equivalent based on 100-year GWPs from AR6. Projected emissions 
for the current policies and NDCs scenarios from Section 4.2.2 (Tables 4.2/3) show median and full range. The 
studies on current policies include post-COVID effects up until 2021(Table 4.2). Note that NDC estimates include 
updates submitted up until October 2021 as well as pledge announcements (Table 4.3).  Historical emissions are 
from the RCMIP historical compiled dataset comprising various sources and methods, as described in (Nicholls 
et al. 2020). 

Emissions gap 

A comparison between the projected emission outcomes of current policies, the NDCs (which include 
unconditional and conditional elements, see Section 4.2.1) and mitigation pathways acting immediately, 
i.e. from 2020 onwards, on reaching different temperature goals in the long-term (see Section 3.3.3) 
allows identifying different ‘emission gaps’ in 2030 (Figure 1). First, the implementation gap between 
‘current policies’ and unconditional and conditional NDCs is estimated to be around 4 and 7 GtCO2eq 
in 2030, respectively (Section 4.2.2 and Tables 4.2 and 4.3). Second, the comparison of unconditional

(conditional) NDCs and long-term mitigation pathways likely limit warming to 2 °C or lower; giving 
rise to a 2030 median emissions gap of 20-26 GtCO2eq (16-24 GtCO2eq) for limiting end-of-century 
warming to 1.5°C (50% chance) with no or limited overshoot and 10-17 GtCO2eq (7-14 GtCO2eq) for 
limiting warming to 2°C (66% chance)4. GHG emissions of NDCs are broadly consistent with 2030 
emission levels of cost-effective long-term pathways staying below 2.5°C.  

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Other ‘gap indicators’ 

Beyond  the  quantification  of  different  GHG  emissions  gaps,  there  is  an  emerging  literature  that 
identifies gaps between current policies, NDCs and long-term temperature in terms of other indicators, 
including for example the deployment of low-carbon energy sources, energy efficiency improvements, 
fossil fuel production levels or investments into mitigation measures (Roelfsema et al. 2020; McCollum 
et al. 2018; SEI et al. 2020). 

A 2030 gap in the contribution of low-carbon energy sources to the energy mix in 2030 between current 
policies and cost-effective long-term temperature pathways is calculated to be around 7%-points (2°C) 
and  13%-points  (1.5°C)  by  Roelfsema  et  al.  (Roelfsema  et  al.  2020).  The  same  authors  estimate  an 
energy intensity improvement gap 10% and 18% for 2030 between current policies pathways and 2°C 
and 1.5°C pathways, respectively. SEI et al. (2020) estimates the ‘fossil fuel production gap’, i.e. the 
level of countries’ planned fossil fuel production expressed in their carbon content to be 120% and 50% 
higher compared to the fossil fuel production consistent with 1.5°C and 2°C pathways, respectively, as 
assessed in IPCC SR1.5 (Rogelj et al. 2018a). The methodology used for this estimation is very similar 
to how emissions gaps are derived (SEI et al. 2019). The gap of global annual average investments in 
low-carbon energy and energy efficiency in 2030 between following current policy on the one hand and 
achieving the NDCs, the 2°C and 1.5°C targets on the other hand, is estimated to be approximately USD 
130, 320, or 480 billion per year (McCollum et al. 2018).  

It is important to note that such comparisons are less straight forward as the link between long-term 
temperature goals and these indicators is less pronounced compared to the emission levels themselves; 
they are therefore associated with greater uncertainty compared to the emissions gap.

Box 4.1 Adaptation Gap and NDCs 

NDCs have been an important driver of national adaptation planning, with cascading effects on sectors 
and  sub-national  action,  especially  in  developing  countries.  Yet,  only  40  developing  countries  have 
quantifiable adaptation targets in their current NDCs; 49 countries include quantifiable targets in their 
national legislation (UNEP 2018a).  

Working Group II contribution to this  Assessment finds that the overall extent of adaptation-related 
responses in human systems is low (high confidence) and that there is limited evidence on the extent to 
which adaptation-related responses in human systems are reducing climate risk (O’Neill et al. 2020). 
Thus  there  is  an  adaptation  gap  (UNEP  2018a),  and  bridging  that  gap  requires  enablers  including 
institutional capacity, planning and investment (UNEP 2016). Estimates of adaptation costs vary greatly 
across  studies.  Recent  studies  based  on  climate  change  under  RCP8.5  report  adaptation  costs  for

developing countries of up to 400 (300 in RCP2.6) billion USD2005 in 2030 (New et al. 2020). Of the 
NDCs submitted in 2015, fifty countries estimated adaptation costs of USD 39 billion annually. Both 
public and private finance for adaptation is increasing, but remains insufficient and constitutes a small 
fraction (4-8%) of total climate finance which is mostly aimed at mitigation. The pledge of developed 
countries of mobilising finance for developing countries to address adaptation needs globally as part of 
the Paris Agreement are insufficient. By 2030 the adaptation needs are expected to be 3 to 6 times larger 
than what is pledged, further increasing towards 2050 (UNEP 2016; New et al. 2020).

4.2.3  Mitigation efforts in subnational and non-state action plans and policies 

The decision adopting the Paris Agreement stresses the importance of  “stronger and more ambitious 
climate action” by non-government and subnational stakeholders, “including civil society, the private 
sector, financial institutions, cities and other subnational authorities, local communities and indigenous 
peoples”  (UNFCCC  2015e).  The  Marrakech  Partnership  for  Global  Action,  launched  in  the  2016 
UNFCCC Conference of Parties by two “high-level champions,” further formalized the contributions 
of  non-government  and  subnational  actors  taking  action  through  seven  thematic  areas  (e.g.,  energy, 
human  settlements,  industry,  land-use, etc.) and  one cross-cutting  area (resilience).  Since then,  non-
state  actors,  e.g.,  companies  and  civil  society,  and  subnational  actors,  e.g.  cities  and  regions,  have 
emerged to undertake a range of largely voluntary carbon mitigation actions (Hsu et al. 2019, 2018) 
both  as  individual  non-state  actors  (NSA  in  the  following)  and  through  national  and  international 
cooperative initiatives (ICIs) (Hsu et al. 2018). ICIs take a variety of forms, ranging from those that 
focus solely on non-state actors to those that engage national and even local governments. They can 
also  range  in  commitment  level,  from  primarily  membership-based  initiatives  that  do  not  require 
specific actions to those that require members to tackle emissions reductions in specific sectors or aim 
for transformational change. 

Quantification of the (potential) impact of these actions is still limited. Almost all studies estimate the 
potential impact of the implementation of actions by NSA and ICI, but do not factor in that they may 
not reach their targets. The main reason for this is that there is very limited data currently available from 
individual actors (e.g., annual GHG inventory reports) and initiatives to assess their progress towards 
their  targets.  A  few  studies  have  attempted  to  assess  progress  of  initiatives  by  looking  into  the 
initiatives’  production  of  relevant  outputs  (Chan  et  al.  2018).  Quantification  does  not  yet  cover  all 
commitments and only a selected number of ICIs are analysed in the existing literature. Most of these 
studies exclude commitments that are not (self-)identified as related to climate change mitigation, those 
that are not connected to international networks, or those that are communicating in languages other 
than English. 

Non  state  action  could  make  significant  contributions  to  achieving  the  Paris  climate  goals  (limited 
evidence, high agreement). However, efforts to measure the extent to which non-state and subnational 
actors go beyond national policy are still nascent (Kuramochi et al. 2020; Hsu et al. 2019) and we do 
not  fully  understand  the  extent  to  which  ambitious  action  by  non-state  actors  is  additional  to  what 
national governments intend to do. Subnational and non-state climate action may also have benefits in 
reinforcing, implementing, or piloting national policy, in place of or in addition to achieving additional 
emissions reductions (Broekhoff et al. 2015; Heidrich et al. 2016; Hsu et al. 2017). 

Quantification of commitments by individual NSAs are limited to date. Attempts to quantify aggregate 
effects  in  2030  of  commitments  by  individual  non-state  and  subnational  actors  are  reported  by 
(Kuramochi et al. 2020; Hsu et al. 2019). (Kuramochi et al. 2020) estimate potential mitigation by more 
than  1,600  companies,  around  6,000  cities  and  many  regions  (cities  assessed  have  a  collective

population  of  579  million,  and  regions  514  million).  Individual  commitments  by  these  subnational 
regions,  cities  and  companies  could  reduce  GHG  emissions  in  2030  by  1.2  to  2.0  GtCO2-eq  yr-1 
compared to current national policies scenario projections, reducing projected emissions by 3.8%–5.5% 
in 2030, if commitments are fully implemented and do not lead to weaker mitigation actions by others 
(Figure 4.1 left). In several countries, NSA commitments could potentially help meet or exceed national 
mitigation targets. 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Quantification  of  potential  emission  reductions  from  international  cooperative  initiatives  have  been 
assessed  in  several  studies,  and  recently  synthesised  (Hsu  et  al.  2020;  Lui  et  al.  2021),  with  some 
initiatives reporting high potential. In Table 4.4 and Figure 4.1, we report estimates of the emissions 
reductions from 19 distinct sub-national and non-state initiatives to mitigate climate change. The table 
shows wide ranges of potential mitigation based on current, target or potential membership, as well as 
a wide diversity of actors and membership assumptions. Current membership reflects the number of 
non-state or subnational actors that are presently committed to a particular initiative; while targeted or 
potential membership represents a membership goal (e.g., increasing from 100 to 200 members) that an 
initiative may seek to achieve (Kuramochi et al. 2020). When adding up emission reduction potentials, 
sub-national and non-state international cooperative initiatives could reduce up to about 20 Gt of CO2-
eq in 2030 (limited evidence, medium agreement). Chapter 8 also presents data on the savings potential 
of  cities  and  it  suggests  that  these  could  reach  2.3  GtCO2-eq  annually  by  2030  and  4.2  GtCO2-eq 
annually for 2050.

Non-state action may be broader than assessed in the literature so far, though subject to uncertainty. 
The  examples  in  Table  4.4  and  Figure  4.1  do  not  include  initiatives  that  target  the  emissions  from 
religious  organisations,  colleges  and  universities,  civic  and  cultural  groups,  and,  to  some  extent, 
households, and in this sense may underestimate sub-national potential for mitigating emissions, rather 
than overestimate it. That said, the estimates are contingent on assumptions that subnational and non-
state actors achieve commitments—both with respect to mitigation and in some cases membership—
and that these actions are not accounted for in nor lead to weakening of national actions. 

Care is to be taken not to depict these efforts as additional to action within national NDCs, unless this 
is clearly established (Broekhoff et al. 2015). There are potential overlaps between individual NSA and 
ICI, and across ICIs. Kuramochi et al. (2020) propose partial and conservative partial effect methods to 
avoid double counting when comparing ambition, a matter that merits further attention. As the diversity 
of actions increased, the potential to count the same reductions multiple times increases. 

Equally important to note here is that none of the studies reviewed in Figure 4.1 quantified the potential 
impact of financial sector actions, e.g., divestment from emission intensive activities (see Section 15.3 
for a more detailed discussion of how financial actors and instruments are addressing climate change). 
Moreover, only a limited number of studies on the impact of actions by diverse actors go beyond 2050 
(see Table 4.4), which may reflect analysts’ recognition of the increasing uncertainties of longer time 
horizons.  Accurate  accounting  methods  can  help  to  avoiding  counting  finance  multiple  times,  and 
methods  across  mitigation  and  finance  would  consider  counting  carbon  market  flows  and  the  tons

reduced. As Table 4.4 and Figure 4.1 indicate, activities by businesses have potential to significantly 
contribute  to  global  mitigation  efforts.  For  example,  the  SBTi  (Science-Based  Targets  Initiative) 
encourages companies to pledge to reduce their emissions at rates which according to SBTI would be 
compatible  with  global  pathways  to  well  below  2°C  or  1.5°C,  with  various  methodologies  being 
proposed (Andersen et al. 2021; Faria and Labutong 2019). Readers may note, however, that the link 
between  emissions  by  individual  actors  and long-term  temperature  goals  cannot  be  inferred  without 
additional assumptions (see Box 4.2). In the energy sector, some voluntary initiatives are also emerging 
to  stop  methane  emissions  associated  with  oil  and  gas  supply  chains.  The  Oil  and  Gas  Methane 
Partnership (OGMP) is a voluntary initiative lead by the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, which has 
recently  published  a  comprehensive  framework  for  methane  detection,  measurement  and  reporting 
(UNEP 2020b). 

Initiatives  made  up  of  cities  and  subnational  regions  have  an  especially  large  potential  to  reduce 
emissions, due to their inclusion of many actors, across a range of different geographic regions, with 
ambitious  emissions  reduction  targets,  and  these  actors’  coverage  of  a  large  share  of  emissions 
(Kuramochi et al. 2020). Hsu et al. (2019) find largest potential in that area. Several subnational regions 
like California and Scotland have set zero emission targets (Höhne et al. 2019), supported by short- and 
medium-term  interim  goals  (Scottish  Government 2020;  State of  California 2018).  Sharing of  effort 
across global and sub-global scales has not been quantified, though one study suggests that non-state 
actors  have  increasingly  adopted  more  diverse  framings,  including  vulnerability,  human  rights  and 
transformational  framings  of  justice  (Shawoo  and  McDermott  2020).  Initiatives  focused  on  forestry 
have  high  emissions  reduction  potential  due  to  the  current  high  deforestation  rates,  and  due  to  the 
ambitious targets of many of these forestry initiatives, such as the New York Declaration on Forests’ 
goal  to  end  deforestation  by  2030  (Höhne  et  al.  2019;  Lui  et  al.  2021),  although  the  Initiative 
acknowledges that insufficient progress has to-date been made towards this goal (NYDF Assessment 
Partners  2020).  On  the  other  hand,  uncertainties  in  global  forest  carbon  emissions  (and  therefore 
potential  reductions)  are  high  and  despite  a  multitude  of  initiatives  in  the  sector,  actually  measured 
deforestation rates have not declined since the initiative was announced in 2014 (7.2, 7.3.1). Moreover, 
not all initiatives are transparent about how they plan to reach their goals and may also rely on offsets. 

Initiatives focused on non-CO2 emissions, and particularly on methane, can achieve sizable reductions, 
in the order of multiple GtCO2-eq yr-1 (see Table 4.4). The Global Cement and Concrete Association 
(formerly the Cement Sustainability Initiative), has contributed to the development of consistent energy 
and  emissions  reporting  from  member  companies.  The  CSI  also  suggested  possible  approaches  to 
balance GHG mitigation and the issues of competitiveness and leakage (Cook and Ponssard 2011). The 
member companies of the GCCA (CSI) have become better prepared for future legislation on managing 
GHG  emissions  and  developed  management  competence  to  respond  to  climate  change  compared  to 
non-member  companies  in  the  cement  sector  (Busch  et  al.  2008;  Global  Cement  and  Concrete 
Association 2020). Accordingly, the cement industry has developed some roadmaps to reach net zero 
GHG around 2050 (Sanjuán et al. 2020). 

It is also important to note that individual NSA and ICI that commit to GHG mitigation activities are 
often  scarce  in  many  crucial  and  ‘hard-to-abate’  sectors,  such  as  iron  and  steel,  cement  and  freight 
transport (see Chapters 10 and 11). Subnational and non-state action efforts could help these sectors 
meet an urgent need to accelerate the commercialisation and uptake of technical options to achieve low 
zero emissions (Bataille 2020).

4.2.4  Mid-century low-emission strategies at the national level 

Chapter 4 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

An increasing amount of literature describes mitigation pathways for the mid-term (up to 2050). We 
assess literature reflecting on the UNFCCC process (4.2.4.1), other official plans and strategies (4.2.4.2) 
and academic literature on mid-century low-emission pathways at the national level (4.2.4.3). After the 
Paris  Agreement  and  the  IPCC  SR1.5  Report,  the  number  of  academic  papers  analysing  domestic 
emission pathways compatible with the 1.5°C limit has been increasing. Governments have developed 
an increasing number of mitigation strategies up to 2050. Several among these strategies aim at net zero 
CO2 or net zero GHG, but it is not yet possible to draw global implications due to the limited size of 
sample (limited evidence, limited agreement). 

 

START BOX 4.2 HERE 
 

Box 4.2 Direct links between an individual actor’s mitigation efforts in the near-term and global 

temperature goals in the long-term cannot be inferred; making direct links requires clear 
distinctions of spatial and temporal scales (Robertson 2021; Rogelj et al. 2021) and explicit 

treatment of ethical judgements made (Holz et al. 2018; Klinsky et al. 2017a; Rajamani et al. 2021; 

Klinsky and Winkler 2018). 

 
The literature frequently refers to  national mitigation pathways up to 2030 or 2050 using long-term 
temperature  limits  in  the  Paris  Agreement  (i.e.,  “2°C”  or  “1.5°C  scenario”).  Without  additional 
information, such denomination is incorrect.  Working Group I reaffirmed “with high confidence the 
AR5 finding that there is a near-linear relationship between cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions 
and the global warming they cause” (WGI SPM AR6). It is not the function of any single country’s 
mitigation efforts, nor any individual actor’s. Emission pathways of individual countries or sectors in 
the  near-  to  mid-term  can  only  be  linked  to  a  long-term  temperature  with  additional  assumptions 
specifying (i) the GHG emissions and removals of other countries up the mid-term; and (ii) the GHG 
emissions  and  removals  of  all  countries  beyond  the  near-  and  mid-term.  For  example,  a  national 
mitigation pathway can be labelled “2°C compatible” if it derives from a global mitigation pathway 
consistent with 2°C via an explicit effort sharing scheme across countries (see 4.2.2.6 and 4.5).

4.2.4.1  GHG Mitigation target under UNFCCC and Paris Agreement 

The Paris Agreement requests that Parties should strive to formulate and communicate long-term low 
GHG development strategies by 2020. (Note that by “long-term”, the UNFCCC means 2050, which is 
the end point of the “mid-term” horizon range in the present report.) As of August 25, 2021, 31 countries 
and the European Union had submitted low-emissions development strategies (LEDS) (Table 4.5). 

By 2018, most long-term strategies targeted 80% emissions reduction in 2050 relative to a reference 
(1990, 2000 or 2005). After IPCC SR1.5 was published, the number of the countries aiming at net zero 
CO2 or GHG emissions has been increasing.5

4.2.4.2  Other national emission pathways to mid-century 

At the 2019 Climate Action Summit, 77 countries indicated their aim to reach net zero CO2 emissions 
by 2050, more the number of countries having submitted LEDS to the UNFCCC. Table 4.6 lists the 
countries that have a national net zero by 2050 target in laws, strategies or other documents (The Energy 
and  Climate  Intelligence  Unit  2019).  Bhutan  and  Suriname  already  have  achieved  net  negative 
emissions.  France  second  “low-carbon  national  strategy”  adopted  in  2020  has  an  objective  of  GHG 
neutrality by 2050. Net zero is also the basis of the recent revision of the official notional price of carbon 
for public investment in France  (Quinet et al. 2019). The Committee on Climate Change of  the UK 
analyses sectoral options and concludes that delivering net zero GHG by 2050 is technically feasible 
but  highly  challenging  (Committee  on  Climate  Change  2019).  For  Germany,  three  steps  to  climate 
neutrality by 2050 are introduced: First, a 65% reduction of emissions by 2030; second, a complete 
switch to climate- neutral technologies, leading to a 95% cut in emissions, all relative to 1990 levels by 
2050; and third balancing of residual emissions through carbon capture and storage (Görz et al. 2020). 
In addition to the countries in Table 4.6, EU reported the net zero GHG emission pathways by 2050 
under Green Deal (European Commission 2019). China and South Korea, have made announcements 
of carbon neutrality by 2060 and net zero GHG emission by 2050, respectively (UN 2020a,b). In the 
case of Japan, the new target to net zero GHG emission by 2050 was announced in 2020 (UN 2020c). 
As of August 25, 2021, a total 121 countries participate in the ‘Climate Ambition Alliance: Net Zero 
2050, together with businesses, cities and regions.

4.2.4.3  Mid-century low emission strategies at the national level in the academic literature 

Since the 2000s, an increasing number of studies have quantified the emission pathways to mid-century 
by using national scale models. In the early stages, the national emission pathways were mainly assessed 
in the developed countries such as Germany, UK, France, the Netherlands, Japan, Canada, and USA. 
For  example,  the  Enquete  Commission  in  Germany  identified  robust  and  sustainable  80%  emission 
reduction pathways (Deutscher Bundestag 2002). In Japan, 2050 Japan Low-Carbon Society scenario 
team (2008) assessed the 70% reduction scenarios in Japan, and summarized the necessary measures to 
“Dozen Actions towards Low-Carbon Societies.”  

Among developing countries, China, India, South Africa assessed their national emission pathways. For 
example, detailed analysis was undertaken to analyse pathways to China’s goal for carbon neutrality 
(EFC 2020). In South Africa, a Scenario Building Team (2007) quantified the Long Term Mitigation 
Scenarios for South Africa.  

Prior to COP21, most of the literature on mid-century mitigation pathways at the national level was 
dedicated to pathways compatible with a 2°C limit (see Box 4.2 for a discussion on the relationship 
between national mitigation pathways and global, long-term targets). After COP21 and the IPCC SR15, 
literature increasingly explored just transition to net zero emissions around 2050. This literature reflects 
on low-emissions development strategies (cognate with SDPS, see 4.3.1) and policies to get to net zero 
CO2 or GHG emissions (Waisman et al. 2021)(Cross-Chapter Box 5). 

Figure 4.2 provides a snapshot of this literature. For a selected set of countries, it shows the mid-century 
emission pathways at national scale that have been registered in the IIASA national mitigation scenario 
database built for the purpose of this Report (Annex III.3.3). Overall, the database contains scenarios 
for 50 countries. Total GHG emission are the most comprehensive information to assess the pathways 
on climate mitigation actions, but energy-related CO2 emissions are the most widely populated data in

the scenarios. As a result, Figure 4.2 shows energy-related CO2 emission trajectories. Scenarios for EU 
countries show reduction trends even in the reference scenario, whereas developing countries and non-
European  developed  countries  such  as  Japan  and  USA  show  emissions increase  in  the  reference.  In 
most  countries  plotted  on  Figure  4.2,  studies  have  found  that  reaching  net  zero  energy  related  CO2 
emissions by 2050 is feasible, although the number of such pathways is limited.

The literature underlines the differences induced by the shift from “2°C scenarios” (typically assumed 
to imply mitigation in 2050 around 80% relative to 1990) to “1.5°C scenarios” (typically assumed to 
imply net zero CO2  or GHG emissions in 2050) (Box 4.2). For Japan, Oshiro et al. (2018) shows the 
difference between the implications of a 2°C scenario (80% reduction of CO2 in 2050) and a 1.5 °C 
scenario (net zero CO2 emission in 2050), suggesting that for a net zero CO2 emission scenario, BECCS 
is a key technology. Their sectoral analysis aims in 2050 at negative CO2 emissions in the energy sector,

and near-zero emissions in the buildings and transport sectors, requiring energy efficiency improvement 
and  electrification.  To  do  so,  drastic  mitigation  is  introduced  immediately,  and,  as  a  result,  the 
mitigation target of Japan’s current NDC is considered not sufficient to achieve a 1.5°C scenario. Jiang 
et al. (2018) also show the possibility of net negative emissions in the power sector in China by 2050, 
indicating that biomass energy with CCS must be adopted on a large scale by 2040. Samadi et al. (2018) 
indicate  the  widespread  use  of  electricity-derived  synthetic  fuels  in  end-use  sectors  as  well  as 
behavioural change for the 1.5 degree scenario in Germany. 

In addition to those analyses, Vishwanathan et al. (2018b), Chunark and Limmeechokchai (2018) and 
Pradhan et al. (2018b) build national scenarios in India, Thailand and Nepal, respectively, compatible 
with a global 1.5°C. Unlike the studies mentioned in the previous paragraph, they translate the 1.5°C 
goal by introducing in their model a carbon price trajectory estimated by global models as sufficient to 
achieve the 1.5°C target. Because of the high economic growth and increase of GHG emissions in the 
reference case, CO2 emissions in 2050 do not reach zero. Finally, the literature also underlines that to 
achieve a 1.5°C target, mitigation measures relative to non-CO2 emissions become important, especially 
in developing countries where the share of non-CO2 emissions is relatively high. (La Rovere et al. 2018) 
treat mitigation actions in AFOLU sector. 

Chapter 3 reported on multi-model analyses, comparison of results using different models, of global 
emissions in the long term. At the national scale, multi-model analyses are still limited, though such 
analyses  are  growing  as  shown  in  Table  4.7.  By  comparing  the  results  among  different  models  and 
different scenarios in a country, the uncertainties on the emission pathways including the mitigation 
measures to achieve a given emission target can be assessed.

This  is  an  international  research  project  which  covers  5  countries  and  1

development strategies both at a national and global level, by investigating 
the  concrete  implications  of  INDCs  for  the  low-carbon  transformation  by

Another type of multi-model analysis is international, i.e., different countries join the same project and 
use their own national models to assess a pre-agreed joint mitigation scenario. By comparing the results 
of various national models, such projects help highlight specific features of each country. More robust 
mitigation measures can be proposed if different types of models participate. These activities can also 
contribute to capacity building in developing countries. 

 

4.2.5  What is to be done to accelerate mitigation? 

4.2.5.1  Overview of accelerated mitigation pathways 
The literature reports an increasing number of accelerated mitigation pathways that are beyond NDCs 
in different regions and countries. There is increasing understanding of the technical content of  such 
pathways,  though  the  literature  remains  limited  on  some  dimensions,  such  as  demand-side  options, 
systems analysis, or mitigation of AFOLU non-CO2 GHGs. The present section describes insights from 
this literature. 

Overall, the literature shows that pathways considered consistent with likely below 2˚C or 1.5˚C (see 
Box  4.2)—including  inter  alia  80%  reduction  of  GHG  emissions  in  2050  relative  to  1990  or  100% 
renewable electricity scenarios—are technically feasible (Esteban et al. 2018; Esteban and Portugal-
Pereira 2014; Lund and Mathiesen 2009; Young and Brans 2017; Mathiesen et al. 2011; Hansen et al. 
2019; Child et al. 2019). They entail increased end-use energy efficiency, significant increases in low-
carbon energy, electrification, other new and transformative technologies in demand sectors, adoption 
of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) to reduce gross emissions, and contribution to net negative 
emissions through carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and carbon sinks. For these pathways to be realized, 
the literature assumes higher carbon prices, combined in policy packages with a range of other policy 
measures. 

The most recent literature also reflects on accelerated mitigation pathways aiming at reaching net zero 
CO2 emissions or net zero GHG emissions by 2050 (4.2.4, Table 4.6) (see glossary entries on net zero 
CO2 emissions and net zero GHG emissions). Specific policies, measures and technologies are needed

to reach such targets. These include, broadly, decarbonising electricity supply, including through low 
carbon energy, radically more efficient use of energy than today; electrification of end-uses (including 
transport / electric vehicles); dramatically lower use of fossil fuels than today; converting other uses to 
low-  or  zero-carbon  fuels  (e.g.,  hydrogen,  bioenergy,  ammonia)  in  hard-to-decarbonise  sectors;  and 
setting ambitious targets to reduce methane and other short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs).  

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Accelerated  mitigation  pathways  differ  by  countries,  depending  inter  alia  on  sources  of  emissions, 
mitigation  opportunities  and  economic  context.  In  China,  India,  Japan  and  other  Southeast  Asian 
countries, more aggressive action related to climate change is also motivated by regional concerns over 
health and air quality related to air pollutants and SLCFs (Ashina et al. 2012; Aggarwal 2017; Dhar et 
al. 2018; Xunzhang et al. 2017; Khanna et al. 2019; China National Renewable Energy Centre 2019; 
Energy Transitions Commission and Rocky Mountain Institute 2019; Oshiro et al. 2018; Jiang et al. 
2018; Kuramochi et al. 2017). Studies of accelerated mitigation pathways in North America tend to 
focus on power sector and imported fuel decarbonisation in the US , and on electrification and demand-
side reductions in Canada (Hammond et al. 2020; Vaillancourt et al. 2017; Jayadev et al. 2020; Hodson 
et  al.  2018;  Victor  et  al.  2018;  Bahn  and  Vaillancourt  2020).  In  Latin  America,  many  pathways 
emphasise  supply-side  mitigation  measures,  finding  that  replacing  thermal  power  generation  and 
developing  bioenergy  (where  resources  are  available)  utilisation  offers  the  greatest  mitigation 
opportunities (Nogueira de Oliveira et al. 2016; Lap et al. 2020; Herreras Martínez et al. 2015; Arango-
Aramburo et al. 2019; Delgado et al. 2020). The European Union-28’s recently announced 2050 climate 
neutrality  goal  is  explored  by  pathways  that  emphasise  complete  substitution  of  fossil  fuels  with 
electricity  generated  by  low-carbon  sources,  particularly  renewables;  demand  reductions  through 
efficiency and conservation, and novel fuels and end-use technologies (Capros et al. 2019; Zappa et al. 
2019; Louis et al. 2020; Duscha et al. 2019; Prognos Öko-Institut Wuppertal-Institut 2020). The limited 
literature so far on Africa’s future pathways suggest those could be shaped by increasing energy access 
and  mitigating  the  air  pollution  and  health  effects  of  relying  on  traditional  biomass  use,  as  well  as 
cleaner expansion of power supply alongside end-use efficiency improvements  (Hamilton and Kelly 
2017; Oyewo et al. 2020, 2019; Wright et al. 2019; Ven et al. 2019; Forouli et al. 2020). 

Though they differ across countries, accelerated mitigation pathways share common characteristics as 
follows. First, energy efficiency, conservation, and reducing energy use in all energy demand sectors 
(buildings, transport, and industry) are included in nearly all literature that addresses future demand 
growth (Jiang et al. 2016; Saveyn et al. 2012; Hanaoka and Masui 2018; Thepkhun et al. 2013; Chilvers 
et al. 2017; Chiodi et al. 2013; Schmid and Knopf 2012; Oshiro et al. 2017a; Shahiduzzaman and Layton 
2017;  Fragkos  et  al.  2017;  Elizondo  et  al.  2017;  Ouedraogo  2017;  Lee  et  al.  2018;  Schiffer  2015; 
Deetman et al. 2013; Zhou et al. 2019; McNeil et al. 2016; Lefèvre et al. 2018; Sugiyama et al. 2019; 
Kato and Kurosawa 2019; Jacobson et al. 2019, 2017; Dioha and Kumar 2020; Dioha et al. 2019; Nieves 
et al. 2019; Jiang et al. 2013; Altieri et al. 2016; Oshiro et al. 2018; Ashina et al. 2012; Vaillancourt et 
al. 2017; Khanna et al. 2019; Victor et al. 2018; Duscha et al. 2019; Hodson et al. 2018; Capros et al. 
2019; Nogueira de Oliveira et al. 2016; Kuramochi et al. 2017) 

Similarly, electrification of industrial processes (up to 50% for EU and China) and transport (e.g., 30-
60% for trucks in Canada), buildings, and district heating and cooling are commonplace (Ashina et al. 
2012; Chiodi et al. 2013; Deetman et al. 2013; Fragkos et al. 2017; Massetti 2012; Mittal et al. 2018; 
Oshiro et al. 2017b; Oshiro et al. 2018; Saveyn et al. 2012; Vaillancourt et al. 2017; Zhou et al. 2019; 
Xunzhang et al. 2017; Hammond et al. 2020; Jiang et al. 2018; Capros et al. 2019). 

Third, lower emissions sources of energy, such as nuclear, renewables, and some biofuels, are seen as 
necessary in all pathways. However, the extent of deployment depends on resource availability. Some

countries  have  set  targets  of  up  to  100%  renewable  electricity,  while  others  such  as  Brazil  rely  on 
increasing biomass up to 40-45% of total or industry energy consumption by 2050. 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Fourth, CCS and CDR are part of many of the national studies reviewed (Ashina et al. 2012; Chilvers 
et al. 2017; Jiang et al. 2013; Kuramochi et al. 2018; Herreras Martínez et al. 2015; Massetti 2012; 
Mittal et al. 2018; Oshiro et al. 2018; Xunzhang et al. 2017; Roberts et al. 2018b; Solano Rodriguez et 
al. 2017; Thepkhun et al. 2013; Vishwanathan et al. 2018b; Kato and Kurosawa 2019; van der Zwaan 
et al. 2016). CCS helps reduce gross emissions but does not remove CO2 from the atmosphere, unless 
combined with bioenergy (BECCS). CO2 removal from sources with no identified mitigation measures 
is considered necessary to help achieve economy-wide net negative emissions (Deetman et al. 2013; 
Massetti 2012; Solano Rodriguez et al. 2017).  

Each option is assessed in more detail in the following sections. 

4.2.5.2  Accelerated decarbonisation of electricity through renewable energy 
Power generation could decarbonise much faster with scaled up deployment of renewable energy and 
storage. Both technologies are mature, available, and fast decreasing in costs, more than for many other 
mitigation  options.  Models  continuously  underestimate  the  speed  at  which  renewables  and  storage 
expand. Higher penetration of renewable energy in the power sector is a common theme in scenarios. 
Some studies provide cost optimal electricity mix under emission constraints, while others explicitly 
explore a 100% renewables or 100% emission free electricity sector (Box 4.3). 

Figure 4.3 shows an increasing share of renewable electricity in most countries historically, with further 
increases  projected  in  many  decarbonisation  pathways.  Targets  for  very  high  shares  of  renewable 
electricity  generation—up  to  100%—are  shown  for  a  number  of  countries,  with  the  global  share 
projected to range from 60% to 70% for 1.5°C with no overshoot (C0) to below 2°C (C4) scenarios. 
Countries  and  States  that  have  set  100%  renewables  targets  include  Scotland  for  2020  (Scottish 
Government 2021), Austria (2030), Denmark (2035) and California (2045) (Figure 4.3).  

While 100% renewable electricity generation by 2050 is found to be feasible, it is not without issues. 
For example, (Jacobson et al. 2017, 2019) find it feasible for 143 countries with only a 9% average 
increase in economic costs (considering all social costs) if annual electricity demand can be reduced by 
57%. Others state that challenges exist with speed of expansion, ensuring sufficient supply at all times 
or  higher  costs  compared  to  other  alternatives  (Clack  et  al.  2017).  In-depth  discussion  of  net  zero 
electricity systems can be found in section 6.6.

Box 4.3. Examples of high-renewable accelerated mitigation pathways 

Many  accelerated  mitigation  pathways  include  high  shares  of  renewable  energy,  with  national 
variations. In Europe, some argue that the EU 2050 net zero GHG emissions goal can be met with 100% 
renewable  power  generation,  including  use  of  renewable  electricity  to  produce  hydrogen,  biofuels 
(including imports), and synthetic hydrocarbons, but will require significant increases in transmission 
capacity  (Duscha  et  al.  2019;  Zappa  et  al.  2019).  Capros  et  al.  (2019)  explore  a  1.5°C  compatible 
pathway that includes 85% renewable generation, with battery, pumped hydro, and chemical storage 
for variable renewables. High-renewable scenarios also exist for individual Member States. In France, 
for example, Krakowski et al. (2016) propose a 100% renewable power generation scenario that relies 
primarily on wind (62%), solar PV (26%) and oceans (12%). To reach this aim, integration into the 
European grid is of vital importance (Brown et al. 2018). While debated, incremental costs could be

limited regardless of specific assumptions of future costs of individual technologies (Shirizadeh et al. 
2020).  In  Germany,  similarly,  100%  renewable  electricity  systems  are  found  feasible  by  numerous 
studies (Oei et al. 2020; Thomas Klaus et al. 2020; Wuppertal-Institut 2021; Hansen et al. 2019). 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

In South Africa, it is found that long-term mitigation goals could be achieved with accelerated adoption 
of solar PV and wind generation, if the electricity sector decarbonises by phasing-out coal entirely by 
2050, even if CCS is not feasible before 2025 (Altieri et al. 2015; Beck et al. 2013). Abundant solar PV 
and  wind  potential,  coupled  with  land  availability  suggest  that  more  than  75%  of  power  generation 
could ultimately originate from solar PV and wind (Oyewo et al. 2019; Wright et al. 2019). 

For the US, share of renewables in power generation in 2050 in accelerated mitigation scenarios vary 
widely,  40%  in  (Hodson  et  al.  2018; Jayadev  et  al.  2020), more  than  half renewable  and  nuclear in 
(Victor et al. 2018) to 100% in (Jacobson et al. 2017, 2019). 

Under cost optimisation scenarios for Brazil, electricity generation, which is  currently dominated by 
hydropower,  could  reach  100%  by  adding  biomass  (Köberle  et  al.  2020).  Other  studies  find  that 
renewable energy, including biomass, could account for more than 30% of total electricity generation 
(Portugal-Pereira et al. 2016; Nogueira de Oliveira et al. 2016). 

In Colombia, where hydropower resources are abundant and potential also exist for solar and wind, a 
deep  decarbonisation  pathway  would  require  57%  renewable  power  generation  by  2050  (Arango-
Aramburo et al. 2019) while others find 80% would be possible (Delgado et al. 2020).  

In Asia, Japan sees could have up to 50% variable renewable electricity supply to reduce CO2 emissions 
by  80%  by  2050  in  some  of  its  deep mitigation  scenarios  (Shiraki  et  al.  2021; Ju  et  al.  2021;  Silva 
Herran and Fujimori 2021; Kato and Kurosawa 2019; Sugiyama et al. 2019). One view of China’s 1.5°C 
pathway includes 59% renewable power generation by 2050 (Jiang et al. 2018). One view of India’s 
1.5°C pathway also includes 52% renewable power generation, and would require storage needs for 
35% of generation (Parikh et al. 2018).

4.2.5.3  Bioenergy plays significant role in resource abundant countries in Latin America and parts 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Chapter 4 

of Europe 

Bioenergy could account for up to 40% of Brazil’s total final energy consumption, and a 60% share of 
fuel  for  light-duty  vehicles  by  2030  (Lefèvre  et  al.  2018),  and  is  considered  most  cost-effective  in 
transport and industrial applications (Lap et al. 2020). BECCS in the power sector is also considered 
cost-effective  option  for  supply-side  mitigation  (Herreras  Martínez  et  al.  2015;  Lucena  et  al.  2016; 
Borba et al. 2012). 

Bioenergy also plays a prominent role in some EU countries’ deep decarbonisation strategies. Domestic 
biomass  alone  can  help  Germany  meet  its  95%  CO2 reduction  by  2050  goal,  and  biomass  and  CCS 
together are needed to reduce CO2 by 80% by 2050 in the Netherlands (Mikova et al. 2019). Studies 
suggest  that  mitigation  efforts  in  France  include  biofuels  and  significant  increases  in  biomass  use, 
including up to 45% of industry energy by 2050 for its net GHG neutrality goal (Doumax-Tagliavini 
and Sarasa 2018; Capros et al. 2019). Increased imports may be needed to meet significant increases in 
EU’s bioenergy use, which could affect energy security and the sustainability of bioenergy production 
outside of the EU (Mandley et al. 2020; Daioglou et al. 2020).  

While BECCS is needed in multiple accelerated mitigation pathways, large-scale land-based biological 
CDR may not prove as effective as expected, and its large-scale deployment may result in ecological 
and social impacts, suggesting it may not be a viable carbon removal strategy in the next 10-20 years 
(Vaughan and Gough 2016; Boysen et al. 2017; Dooley and Kartha 2018). The effectiveness of BECCS 
could depend on local contexts, choice of biomass, fate of initial aboveground biomass and fossil-fuel 
emissions offsets—carbon removed through BECCS could be offset by losses due to land-use change 
(Harper et al. 2018; Butnar et al. 2020; Calvin et al. 2021). Large-scale BECCS may push planetary 
boundaries for  freshwater use, exacerbate land-system change, significantly  alter  biosphere integrity 
and biogeochemical flows (Heck et al. 2018; Stenzel et al. 2021; Fuhrman et al. 2020; Ai et al. 2021). 
See 7.4 and 12.5 for further discussions.  

4.2.5.4  CCS may be needed to mitigate emissions from the remaining fossil fuels that cannot be 

decarbonised, but the economic feasibility of deployment is not yet clear 

CCS  is  present  in  many  accelerated  mitigation  scenarios  in  the  literature.  In  Brazil,  (Nogueira  de 
Oliveira  et  al.  2016)  consider  BECCS  and  CCS  in  hydrogen  generation  more  feasible  than  CCS  in 
thermal power plants, with costs ranging from USD70-100/tCO2. Overall, (van der Zwaan et al. 2016) 
estimate that 33-50% of total electricity generation in Latin America could be ultimately covered by 
CCS. In Japan, CCS and increased bioenergy adoption plus waste-to-energy and hydrogen-reforming 
from fossil fuel are all considered necessary in the power sector in existing studies, with potential up to 
200 MtCO2 per year (Ashina et al. 2012; Oshiro et al. 2017a; Kato and Kurosawa 2019; Sugiyama et 
al. 2021). In parts of the EU, after 2030, CCS could become profitable with rising CO2 prices (Schiffer 
2015). CDR is seen as necessary in some net GHG neutrality pathways (Capros et al. 2019) but evidence 
on cost-effectiveness is scarce and uncertain (European Commission 2013). For France and Sweden, 
(Millot  et  al.  2020)  include  CCS  and  BECCS  to  meet  net  zero  GHG  emissions  by  2050.  For  Italy, 
(Massetti 2012) propose a zero-emission electricity scenario with a combination of renewable and coal, 
natural gas, and BECCS.  

In China, an analysis concluded that CCS is necessary for remaining coal and natural gas generation 
out to 2050 (Jiang et al. 2018; Energy Transitions Commission and Rocky Mountain Institute 2019). 
Seven to 10 CCS projects with installed capacity of 15 GW by 2020 and total CCS investment of 105 
billion  RMB  (2010  RMB)  are  projected  to  be  needed  by  2050  under  a  2°C  compatible  pathway 
according to (Jiang et al. 2016, 2013; Lee et al. 2018). Under 1.5°C pathway, an analysis found China 
would need full CCS coverage of the remaining 12% of power generation from coal and gas power and

250 GW of BECCS (Jiang et al. 2018). Combined with expanded renewable and nuclear development, 
total estimated investment in this study is 5% of China's total GDP in 2020, 1.3% in 2030, and 0.6% in 
2050 (Jiang et al. 2016). 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Views  regarding  feasibility  of  CCS  can  vary  greatly  for  the  same  country.  In  the  case  of  India’s 
electricity sector for instance, some studies indicate that CCS would be necessary (Vishwanathan et al. 
2018a), while others do not—citing concerns around its feasibility due to limited potential sites and 
issues related to socio-political acceptance—, and rather point to very ambitious increase in renewable 
energy, which in turn could pose significant challenges in systematically integrating renewable energy 
into the current energy systems (Viebahn et al. 2014; Mathur and Shekhar 2020). Some limitations of 
CCS, including uncertain costs, lifecycle and net emissions, other biophysical resource needs, and social 
acceptance  are  acknowledged  in  existing  studies  (Sekera  and  Lichtenberger  2020;  Jacobson 
2019;Viebahn et al. 2014; Mathur and Shekhar 2020)  

While national mitigation portfolios aiming at net zero emissions or lower will need to include some 
level of CDR, the choice of methods and the scale and timing of their deployment will depend on the 
ambition for gross emission reductions, how sustainability and feasibility constraints are managed, and 
how  political  preferences  and  social  acceptability  evolve  (Cross-Chapter  Box  8).  Furthermore, 
mitigation deterrence may create further uncertainty, as anticipated future CDR could dilute incentives 
to reduce emissions now (Grant et al. 2021), and the political economy of net negative emissions has 
implications for equity (Mohan et al. 2021). 

4.2.5.5  Nuclear power is considered strategic for some countries, while others plan to reach their 

mitigation targets without additional nuclear power 

Nuclear  power  generation  is  developed  in  many  countries,  though  larger-scale  national  nuclear 
generation does not tend to associate with significantly lower carbon emissions (Sovacool et al. 2020). 
Unlike other energy sources such as wind and PV solar, levelized costs of nuclear power has been rising 
in the last decades (Portugal-Pereira et al. 2018; Gilbert et al. 2017; Grubler 2010). This is mainly due 
to overrun of overnight construction costs related to delays in project approvals and construction, and 
more  stringent  passive  safety  measures,  which  increases  the  complexity  of  systems.  After  the 
Fukushima Dai-Ichi accident in Japan, nuclear programs in several countries have been phased out or 
cancelled (Carrara 2020; Huenteler et al. 2012; Kharecha and Sato 2019; Hoffman and Durlak 2018). 
Also  the  compatibility  of  conventional  PWR  and  BWR  reactors  with  large  proportion  of  renewable 
energy in the grid it is yet to be fully understood. 

Accelerated mitigation scenarios offer contrasting views on the share of nuclear in power generation. 
In  the  US,  (Victor  et  al.  2018)  build  a  scenario  in  which  nuclear  contributes  23%  of  CO2  emission 
reductions needed to reduce GHG emissions by 80% from 2005 levels by 2050. Deep power sector 
decarbonisation pathways could require a two-folded increase in nuclear capacity according to (Jayadev 
et al. 2020) for the U.S., and nearly a ten-fold increase for Canada, but may be difficult to implement 
(Vaillancourt et al. 2017). For China to meet a 1.5°C pathway or achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, 
nuclear may represent 14%-28% of power generation in 2050 according to (Jiang et al. 2018; China 
National  Renewable  Energy  Centre  2019;  Energy  Transitions  Commission  and  Rocky  Mountain 
Institute 2019). For South Korea, (Hong et al. 2014; Hong and Brook 2018) find that increasing nuclear 
power can help complement renewables in decarbonizing the grid. Similarly, India has put in place a 3-
stage nuclear programme which aims to enhance nuclear power capacity from the current level of  6 
GW  to  63  GW  by  2032,  if  fuel  supply  is  ensured  (GoI  2015).  Nuclear  energy  is  also  considered 
necessary as part of accelerated mitigation pathways in Brazil, although it is not expected to increase 
significantly by 2050 even under stringent low carbon scenarios (Lucena et al. 2016). France developed 
its nuclear strategy in response to energy security concerns after the 1970s Oil Crisis, but has committed

to reducing nuclear’s share of power generation to 50% by 2035 (Millot et al. 2020). Conversely, some 
analysis find deep mitigation pathways, including net zero GHG emissions and 80-90% reduction from 
2013 levels, feasible without additional nuclear power in EU-28 and Japan respectively, but assuming 
a combination of bio- and novel fuels and CCS or land-use based carbon sinks (Kato and Kurosawa 
2019; Duscha et al. 2019).  

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Radically  more  efficient  use  of  energy  than  today,  including  electricity,  is  a  complementary  set  of 
measures, explored in the following. 

4.2.5.6  Efficient cooling, SLCFs and co-benefits 
In warmer climate regions undergoing economic transitions, improving the energy efficiency of cooling 
and refrigeration equipment is often important for managing peak electricity demand and can have co-
benefits for climate mitigation as well as SLCF reduction, as expected in India, Africa, and Southeast 
Asia in the future. 

Air conditioner adoption is rising significantly in  low- and middle-income countries as incomes rise 
and average temperatures increase, including in Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, 
Vietnam,  and  the  Philippines,  as  well  as  Brazil,  Pakistan,  Bangladesh,  and  Nigeria  (Biardeau  et  al. 
2020). Cooling appliances are expected to increase from 3.6 billion to 9.5 billion by 2050, though up to 
14 billion could be required to provide adequate cooling for all (Birmingham Energy Institute 2018). 
Current technology pathways are not sufficient to deliver universal access to cooling or meet the 2030 
targets under the SDGs, but energy efficiency, including in equipment efficiency like air conditioners, 
can  reduce  this  demand  and  help  limit  additional  emissions  that  would  further  exacerbate  climate 
change (UNEP and IEA 2020; Dreyfus et al. 2020; Biardeau et al. 2020). Some countries (India, South 
Africa) have started to recognise the need for more efficient equipment in their mitigation strategies 
(Paladugula et al. 2018; Altieri et al. 2016; Ouedraogo 2017). 

One possible synergy between SLCF and climate change mitigation is the simultaneous improvement 
in  energy  efficiency  in  refrigeration  and  air-conditioning  equipment  during  the  hydrofluorocarbon 
(HFC)  phase-down,  as  recognised  in  the  Kigali  Amendment  to  the  Montreal  Protocol.  The  Kigali 
Amendment  and  related  national  and  regional  regulations  are  projected  to  reduce  future  radiative 
forcing from HFCs by about half in 2050 compared to a scenario without any HFC controls, and to 
reduce future global average warming in 2100 from a baseline of 0.3-0.5°C to less than 0.1°C, according 
to  a  recent  scientific  assessment  of  a  wide  literature  (World  Meteorological  Organization  2018).  If 
ratified by signatories, the rapid phase-down of HFCs under the Kigali Amendment is possible because 
of extensive replacement of high-global warming potential (GWP) HFCs with commercially available 
low-GWP  alternatives  in  refrigeration  and  air-conditioning  equipment.  Each  country’s  choices  of 
alternative refrigerants will likely be determined by energy efficiency, costs, and refrigerant toxicity 
and flammability. National and regional regulations will be needed to drive technological innovation 
and development (Polonara et al. 2017). 

4.2.5.7  Efficient buildings, cooler in summer, warmer in winter, towards net zero energy 
Most  accelerated  mitigation  pathway  scenarios  include  significant  increase  in  building  energy 
efficiency. Countries in cold regions, in particular, often focus more on building sector GHG emissions 
mitigation measures such as improving building envelopes and home appliances, and electrifying space 
heating and water heating. 

For  example,  scenarios  for  Japan  project  continued  electrification  of  residential  and  commercial 
buildings to 65% and 79% respectively by 2050 to reach 70-90% CO2 reduction from 2013 levels (Kato 
and Kurosawa 2019). Similarly, a mitigation pathway for China compatible with 1.5°C would require 
58% to 70% electrification of buildings according to (Jiang et al. 2018; Energy Transitions Commission

and Rocky Mountain Institute 2019; China National Renewable Energy Centre 2019). For the EU-28 
to reach net carbon neutrality, complete substitution of fossil fuels with electricity (up to 65% share), 
district heating, and direct use of solar and ambient heat are projected to be needed for buildings, along 
with increased use of solar thermal and heat pumps for heating  (Duscha et al. 2019). In the UK and 
Canada, improved insulation to reduce energy demand and efficient building appliances and heating 
systems are important building strategies needed to reduce emissions to zero by 2050  (Roberts et al. 
2018a;  Vaillancourt  et  al.  2017;  Chilvers  et  al.  2017).  In  Ireland,  achieving  80%-95%  emissions 
reduction  below  1990  levels  by  2050  also  requires  changes  in  building  energy  technology  and 
efficiency,  including  improving  building  envelopes,  fuel  switching  for  residential  buildings,  and 
replacing service-sector coal use with gas and renewables according to (Chiodi et al. 2013). In South 
Africa, improving industry and building energy efficiency is also considered a key part of mitigation 
strategies (Ouedraogo 2017; Altieri et al. 2016). 

In addition, an increasing number of countries have set up Net Zero Energy Building targets (Table 4.8) 
(Höhne et al. 2020). Twenty seven countries have developed roadmap documents for NZEBs, mostly 
in developed countries in Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific, focusing on energy efficiency and 
improved insulation and design, renewable and smart technologies (Mata et al. 2020). The EU, Japan 
and the U.S. (the latter for public buildings only) have set targets for shifting new buildings to 100% 
near-zero  energy  buildings  by  2030,  with earlier  targets for public buildings.  Scotland  has  a similar 
target for 2050 (Höhne et al. 2020). Technologies identified as needed for achieving near-zero energy 
buildings vary by region, but include energy-efficient envelope components, natural ventilation, passive 
cooling and heating, high performance building systems, air heat recovery, smart and information and 
communication technologies, and changing future heating and cooling supply fuel mixes towards solar, 
geothermal, and biomass (Mata et al. 2020). Subnational regions in Spain, U.S., Germany, and Mexico 
have set local commitments to achieving net zero carbon new buildings by 2050, with California having 
the most ambitious aspirational target of zero net energy buildings for all new buildings by 2030 (Höhne 
et al. 2020). The EU is also targeting the retrofitting of 3% of existing public buildings to zero-energy, 
with emphasis on greater thermal insulation of building envelopes (Mata et al. 2020; Höhne et al. 2020). 
China’s  roadmaps  have  emphasised  insulation  of  building  envelope,  heat  recovery  systems  in 
combination with renewable energy, including solar, shallow geothermal, and air source heat pumps 
(Mata et al. 2020).

4.2.5.8  Electrifying transport 
Electrification of transport in tandem with power sector decarbonisation is expected to be a key strategy 
for deep CO2 mitigation in many countries. Passenger transport and light duty freight can already be 
electrified, but electrifying heavy-duty road transport and fuel switching in aviation and shipping are 
much more difficult and have not been addressed in most of the recent research. 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

In  Germany,  widespread  electrification  of  private  vehicles  is  expected  by  2030  (Schmid  and  Knopf 
2012)  while  for  the  EU-28,  50%  overall  transport  electrification  (excluding  feedstock)  and  75% 
electrification  of  road  transport  is  needed  to  reach  net  carbon  neutrality  according  to  (Duscha  et  al. 
2019). In addition, novel fuels such as hydrogen, synthetic hydrocarbons and sustainable biogenic fuels 
are needed to decarbonise aviation and water transport to achieve net carbon neutrality (Duscha et al. 
2019). 

In India, electrification, hydrogen, and biofuels are key to decarbonising the transport sector (Dhar et 
al.  2018;  Mittal  et  al.  2018;  Vishwanathan  et  al.  2018b;  Mathur  and  Shekhar  2020).  Under  a  1.5°C 
scenario,  nearly  half  of  the  light-duty  passenger  vehicle  stock  needs  to  be  electrified  according  to 
(Parikh et al. 2018). In China, a 1.5°C-compatible pathway  would requires electrification  of 2/5th of 
transport (Jiang et al. 2018; China National Renewable Energy Centre 2019).  

Similarly,  in  Canada,  electrification  of  59%  of  light-duty  trucks  and  23%  of  heavy-duty  trucks  are 
needed as part of overall strategy to reduce CO2 emissions by 80% by 2050. In addition, hydrogen is 
expected to play a major role by accounting for nearly one-third of light-duty trucks, 68% of heavy-
duty trucks, and 33% of rail by 2050 according to Hammond et al. (2020). 

4.2.5.9  Urban form meets information technology 
Beyond  technological  measures,  some  densely  populated  countries  including  Germany,  Japan,  and 
India are exploring using information technology/internet-of-things (IOT) to support mode-shifting and 
reduce mobility demand through broader behaviour and lifestyle changes (Aggarwal 2017; Ashina et 
al.  2012;  Canzler  and  Wittowsky  2016;  Dhar  et  al.  2018;  Vishwanathan  et  al.  2018b).  In  Japan, 
accelerated  mitigation  pathways  consider  the  use  of  information  technology  and  IOT  to  transform 
human behaviour and transition to a sharing economy (Ashina et al. 2012; Oshiro et al. 2017a, 2018). 
In Germany, one study points to including electromobility information and communication technologies 
in the  transport sector  as  key  (Canzler  and  Wittowsky  2016)  while  another  emphasise shifting  from 
road to rail transport, and reduced distances travelled as other possible transport strategies (Schmid and 
Knopf  2012).  India’s  transport  sector  strategies  also  include  use  of  information  technology  and  the 
internet, a transition to a sharing economy, and increasing infrastructure investment (Dhar et al. 2018; 
Vishwanathan  et  al.  2018b).  Behaviour  and  lifestyle  change  along  with  stakeholder  integration  in 
decision-making are considered key to implementing new transport policies (Aggarwal 2017; Dhar et 
al. 2018). 

4.2.5.10  Industrial energy efficiency 
Industrial energy efficiency improvements are considered in nearly all countries but for countries where 
industry  is  expected  to  continue  to  be  a  key  sector,  new  and  emerging  technologies  that  require 
significant R&D investment, such as hydrogen and CCS, make ambitious targets achievable. 

In China, for example,  non-conventional electrical and renewable technologies, including low-grade 
renewable  heat,  biomass  use  for  high-temperature  heat  in  steel  and  cement  sectors,  and  additional 
electrification  in  glass,  food  and  beverage,  and  paper  and  pulp  industries,  are  part  of  scenarios  that 
achieve 60% reduction in national CO2 emission by 2050 (Khanna et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2019), in 
addition to increased recycled steel for electric arc furnaces and direct electrolysis or hydrogen-based 
direct reduction of iron and CCS utilisation in clinker and steel-making (China National Renewable

Energy Centre 2019; Jiang et al. 2018). Similarly, in India, (Vishwanathan and Garg 2020) point to the 
need for renewable energy and CCS to decarbonize the industrial sector. In EU-28, net CO2 neutrality 
can only be reached with 92% reduction in industrial emissions relative to 1990, through electrification, 
efficiency improvement and new technologies such as hydrogen-based direct reduction of steel, low 
carbon cement, recycling (Duscha et al. 2019). Both China and EU see 50% of industry electrification 
by 2050 as needed to meet 1.5°C and net carbon neutrality pathways (Jiang et al. 2018; Capros et al. 
2019). 

Aggressive adoption of technology solutions for power sector  decarbonisation coupled with end-use 
efficiency improvements and low-carbon electrification of buildings, industry and transport provides a 
pathway for  accelerated mitigation  in  many  key  countries,  but  will  still be  insufficient to meet  zero 
emission/1.5°C  goals  for  all  countries.  Although  not included in  a majority  of the  studies  related to 
pathways  and  national  modelling  analysis,  energy  demand  reduction  through  deeper  efficiency  and 
other measures such as lifestyle changes and system solutions that go beyond components, as well as 
the co-benefits of the reduction of short-lived pollutants, needs to be evaluated for inclusion in future 
zero emission/1.5°C pathways. 

4.2.5.11  Lowering demand, downscaling economies 
Studies have identified socio-technological pathways to help achieve net zero CO2 and GHG targets at 
national scale, that in aggregate are crucial to keeping global temperature below agreed limits. However, 
most of the literature focuses on supply-side options, including carbon dioxide removal mechanisms 
(BECCS, afforestation, and others) that are not fully commercialised (Cross-Chapter Box 8). Costs to 
research, deploy, and scale up these technologies are often high. Recent studies have addressed lowering 
demand through energy conversion efficiency improvements, but few studies have considered demand 
reduction through efficiency (Grubler et al. 2018) and the related supply implications and mitigation 
measures. 

Five main drivers of long-term energy demand reduction that can meet the 1.5˚C target include quality 
of life, urbanisation, novel energy services, diversification of end-user roles, and information innovation 
(Grubler et al. 2018). A low-energy-demand scenario requires fundamental societal and institutional 
transformation from current patterns of consumption, including: decentralised services and increased 
granularity (small-scale, low-cost technologies to provide decentralised services), increased use value 
from  services  (multi-use  vs.  single  use),  sharing  economies,  digitalisation,  and  rapid  transformation 
driven by end-user demand. This approach to transformation differs from the status quo and current 
climate  change  policies  in  emphasising  energy  end-use  and  services  first,  with  downstream  effects 
driving intermediate and upstream structural change. 

Radical  low  carbon  innovation  involves  systemic,  cultural,  and  policy  changes  and  acceptance  of 
uncertainty in the beginning stages. However, the current dominant analytical perspectives are grounded 
in neoclassical economics and social psychology, and focus primarily on marginal changes rather than 
radical transformations (Geels et al. 2018). Some literature is beginning to focus on mitigation through 
behaviour  and lifestyle changes,  but specific policy measures for  supporting  such  changes and their 
contribution to emission reductions remain unclear (see also Section 4.4.2 and Chapter 5). 

4.2.5.12  Ambitious targets to reduce short-lived climate forcers, including methane 
Recent research shows that temperature increases are likely to exceed 1.5°C during the 2030s and 2°C 
by mid-century unless both CO2 and short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) are reduced (Shindell et al. 
2017; Rogelj et al. 2018a). Because of their short lifetimes (days to a decade and a half), SLCFs can 
provide fast mitigation, potentially avoiding warming of up to 0.6 ºC at 2050 and up to 1.2 ºC at 2100 
(Ramanathan and Xu 2010; Xu and Ramanathan 2017). In Asia especially, co-benefits of drastic CO2 
and  air  pollution  mitigation  measures  reduce  emissions  of  methane,  black  carbon,  sulphur  dioxide,

nitrogen  oxide,  and  fine  particulate  matter  by  approximately  23%,  63%,  73%,  27%,  and  65% 
respectively  in  2050  as  compared  to  2010  levels.  Including  the  co-benefits  of  reduction  of  climate 
forcing adds significantly to the benefits reducing air pollutants (Hanaoka and Masui 2018).  

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

To achieve net zero GHG emissions implies consideration of targets for non-CO2 gases. While methane 
emissions have grown less rapidly than CO2 and F-gases since 1990 (Chapter 2), the literature urges 
action  to  bring  methane  back  to  a  pathway  more  in  line  with  the  Paris  goals  (Nisbet  et  al.  2020). 
Measures to reduce methane emissions from anthropogenic sources are considered intractable – where 
they sustain livelihoods – but also becoming more feasible, as studies report the options for mitigation 
in agriculture without undermining food security (Wollenberg et al. 2016; Frank et al. 2017; Nisbet et 
al. 2020). The choice of emission metrics has implications for SLCF (Cain et al. 2019)(Cross-Chapter 
Box 2). Ambitious reductions of methane are complementary to, rather than substitutes for, reductions 
in CO2 (Nisbet et al. 2020). 

Rapid SLCF reductions, specifically of methane, black carbon, and tropospheric ozone have immediate 
co-benefits including meeting sustainable development goals for reducing health burdens of household 
air pollution and reversing health- and crop-damaging tropospheric ozone (Jacobson 2002, 2010). SLCF 
mitigation measures can have regional impacts, including avoiding premature deaths in Asia and Africa 
and  warming  in  central  and  Northern  Asia,  southern  Africa,  and  the  Mediterranean  (Shindell  et  al. 
2012). Reducing outdoor air pollution could avoid 2.4 million premature deaths and 52 million tonnes 
of  crop  losses for  four  major  staples  (Haines  et  al. 2017).  Existing research  emphasises  climate  and 
agriculture  benefits  of  methane  mitigation  measures  with  relatively  small  human  health  benefits 
(Shindell et al. 2012). Research also predicts that black carbon mitigation could substantially benefit 
global climate and human health, but there is more uncertainty about these outcomes than about some 
other predictions (Shindell et al. 2012). Other benefits to SLCF reduction include reducing warming in 
the critical near-term, which will slow amplifying feedbacks, reduce the risk of non-linear changes, and 
reduce long-term cumulative climate impacts—like sea-level rise—and mitigation costs (Hu et al. 2017; 
UNEP and WMO 2011; Rogelj et al. 2018a; Xu and Ramanathan 2017; Shindell et al. 2012). 

4.2.5.13  System  analysis  solutions  are  only  beginning  to  be  recognised  in  current  literature  on 
accelerated  mitigation  pathways,  and  rarely  included  in  existing  national  policies  or 
strategies 

Most models and studies fail to address system impacts of widespread new technology deployment, for 
example: 1) material and resources needed for hydrogen production or additional emissions and energy 
required  to  transport  hydrogen;  or  2)  materials,  resources,  grid  integration,  and  generation  capacity 
expansion limits of a largely decarbonised power sector and electrified transport sector. These impacts 
could limit regional and national scale-ups. 

Systemic  solutions  are  also  not  being  sufficiently  discussed,  such  as  low-carbon  materials;  light-
weighting of buildings, transport, and industrial equipment; promoting circular economy, recyclability 
and  reusability,  and  addressing  the  food-energy-water  nexus.  These  solutions  reduce  demand  in 
multiple sectors, improve overall supply chain efficiency, and require cross-sector policies. Using fewer 
building materials could reduce the need for cement, steel, and other materials and thus the need for 
production and freight transport. Concrete can also be produced from low carbon cement, or designed 
to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. Few regions have developed comprehensive policies or strategies 
for  a  circular  economy,  with  the  exception  of  the  EU  and  China,  and  policies  in  the  EU  have  only 
emerged  within  the  last  decade.  While  China’s  circular  economy  policies  emphasises  industrial 
production, water, pollution and scaling-up in response to rapid economic growth and industrialisation, 
EU’s  strategy  is  focused  more  narrowly  on  waste  and  resources  and  overall  resource  efficiency  to 
increase economic competitiveness (McDowall et al. 2017).

Increased bioenergy consumption is considered in many 1.5˚C and 2˚C scenarios. System thinking is 
needed  to  evaluate  bioenergy’s  viability  because  increased  demand  could  affect  land  and  water 
availability, food prices, and trade (Sharmina et al. 2016). To adequately address the energy-water-food 
nexus, policies and models must consider interconnections, synergies, and trade-offs among and within 
sectors, which is currently not the norm (see 12.4). 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

A  systems  approach  is  also  needed  to  support  technological  innovation.  This  includes  recognising 
unintended consequences of political support mechanisms for technology adoption and restructuring 
current incentives to realise multi-sector benefits. It also entails assimilating knowledge from multiple 
sources as a basis for policy and decision-making (Hoolohan et al. 2019). 

Current literature does not explicitly consider systematic, physical drivers of inertia, such as capital and 
infrastructure needed to support accelerated mitigation (Pfeiffer et al. 2018). This makes it difficult to 
understand what is needed to successfully shift from current limited mitigation actions to significant 
transformations needed to rapidly achieve deep mitigation. 

 

4.2.6  Implications of accelerated mitigation for national development objectives 

Introduction 

4.2.6.1 
This section examines how accelerated mitigation may impact the realisation of development objectives 
in the near- and mid-term. It focuses on three objectives discussed in the literature, sustaining economic 
growth (4.2.6.2), providing employment (4.2.6.3), and alleviating poverty and ensuring equity (4.2.6.4). 
It complements similar review performed at global level in section 3.6. For a comprehensive survey of 
research on the impact of mitigation in other areas (including air quality, health, and biodiversity), see 
Karlsson et al. (2020).  

4.2.6.2  Mitigation and economic growth in the near- and mid-term 
A  significant  part  of  the  literature  assesses  the  impacts  of  mitigation  on  GDP,  consistent  with 
policymakers’ interest in this variable. It must be noted upfront that computable equilibrium models, 
on which our assessments are mostly based, capture the impact of mitigation on GDP and other core 
economic variables while typically overlooking other effects that may matter (like improvements in air 
quality). Second, even though GDP (or better, GDP per capita) is not an indicator of welfare (Fleurbaey 
and Blanchet 2013), changes in GDP per capita  across countries and over time are highly correlated 
with changes in welfare indicators in the areas of poverty, health, and education (Gable et al. 2015). 
The mechanisms linking mitigation to GDP outlined below would remain valid even with alternative 
indicators of well-being (5.2.1). Third, another stream of literature criticises the pursuit of economic 
growth as a goal, instead advocating a range of alternatives and suggesting modelling of post-growth 
approaches to achieve rapid mitigation while improving social outcomes  (Hickel et al. 2021). In the 
language of the present chapter, these alternatives constitute alternative development pathways. 

Most  country-level  mitigation  modelling  studies  in  which  GDP  is  an  endogenous  variable  report 
negative impacts of mitigation on GDP in 2030 and 2050, relative to the reference (robust evidence, 
high agreement), for example (Nong et al. 2017) for Australia, (Chen et al. 2013) for Brazil, (Mu et al. 
2018a; Cui et al. 2019; Zhao et al. 2018; Li et al. 2017; Dong et al. 2018; Dai et al. 2016) for China, 
(Álvarez-Espinosa et al. 2018) for Colombia, (Fragkos et al. 2017) for the EU, (Mittal et al. 2018) for 
India,  (Fujimori  et  al.  2019)  for  Japan,  (Veysey  et  al.  2014)  for  Mexico,  (Pereira  et  al.  2016)  for 
Portugal,  (Alton  et  al.  2014;  van  Heerden  et  al.  2016)  for  South  Africa,  (Chunark  et  al.  2017)  for 
Thailand, (Acar and Yeldan 2016) for Turkey, (Roberts et al. 2018b) for the UK, (Chen and Hafstead 
2019;  Zhang  et  al.  2017)  for  the  USA,  (Nong  2018)  for  Vietnam)  (Figure  4.4).  The  downward 
relationship between mitigation effort and emissions is strong in studies up to 2030, much weaker for

studies  looking  farther  ahead.  In  all  reviewed  studies,  however,  GDP  continues  to  grow  even  with 
mitigation. It may be noted that none of the studies assessed above integrates the benefits of mitigation 
in terms of reduced impacts of climate change or lower adaptation costs. This is not surprising since 
these  studies  are  at  national  or  regional  scale  and  do  not  extend  beyond  2050,  whereas  the  benefits 
depend on global emissions and primarily occur after 2050. Discussion on reduced impacts is provided 
in section 3.6.2 and Cross-Working Group Box 1.

Two  major  mechanisms  interplay  to  explain  the  impact  of  mitigation  on  GDP.  First,  the  carbon 
constraint  imposes  reduced  use  of  a  production  factor  (fossil  energy),  thus  reducing  GDP.  In  the 
simulations, the mechanism at work is that firms and households reduce their use of GHG-intensive 
goods and services in response to higher prices due to reduced fossil energy use. Second, additional 
investment required for mitigation partially crowds out productive investment elsewhere (Fujimori et 
al.  2019),  except  in  Keynesian  models  in  which  increased  public  investment  actually  boosts  GDP 
(Pollitt et al. 2015; Bulavskaya and Reynès 2018; Landa Rivera et al. 2016). Magnitude and duration 
of GDP loss depend on the stringency of the carbon constraint, the degree of substitutability with less-
GHG-intensive  goods  and  services,  assumptions  about  costs  of  low-carbon  technologies  and  their 
evolution over time (e.g., (Duan et al. 2018; van Meijl et al. 2018; Cui et al. 2019) and decisions by 
trading partners, which influence competitiveness impacts for firms (Alton et al. 2014; Fragkos et al. 
2017) (high evidence, high agreement). 

In the near-term, presence of long-lived emissions intensive capital stock, and rigidities in the labour 
market (Devarajan et al. 2011) and other areas may increase impacts of mitigation on GDP. In the mid-
term,  on  the  other  hand,  physical  and  human  capital,  technology,  institutions,  skills  or  location  of 
households  and  activities  are  more  flexible.  The  development  of  renewable  energy  may  help  create 
more employment and demands for new skills, particularly in the high-skill labour market (Hartley et 
al. 2019). In addition, cumulative mechanisms such as induced technical change or learning by doing 
on low-emissions technologies and process may reduce the impacts of mitigation on GDP.

Country-level studies find that the negative impacts of mitigation on GDP can be reduced if pre-existing 
economic  or  institutional  obstacles  are  removed  in  complement  to  the  imposition  of  the  carbon 
constraint (robust evidence, high agreement). For example, if the carbon constraint takes the form of a 
carbon tax or of permits that are auctioned, the way the proceeds from the tax (or the revenues from the 
sales of permits) are used is critical for the overall macroeconomic impacts (Chen et al. 2013). (For a 
detailed  discussion  of  different  carbon  pricing  instruments,  including  the  auctioning  of  permits,  see 
Section 13.6.3). 

Figure 4.5 shows that depending on the choice of how to implement a carbon constraint, the same level 
of  carbon  constraint  can  yield  very  different  outcomes  for  GDP.  The  potential  for  mitigating  GDP 
implications of mitigation through fiscal reform is discussed in 4.4.1.8. 

More generally, mitigation costs can be reduced by proper policy design if the economy initially is not 
on the efficiency frontier (Grubb 2014), defined as the set of configurations within which the quality of 
the environment and economic activity cannot be simultaneously improved given current technologies 
– such improvements in policy design may include reductions in distortionary taxes. Most of the studies 
which find that GDP increases with mitigation in the near-term precisely assume that the economy is 
initially  not  on  the  frontier.  Making  the  economy  more  efficient—i.e.,  lifting  the  constraints  that 
maintain  the  economy  in  an  interior  position—creates  opportunities  to  simultaneously  improve 
economic activity and reduce emissions. Table 4.9 describes the underlying assumptions in a selection 
of studies.

Based on (Alton et al. 2014; Devarajan et al. 2011; Fernandez and Daigneault 2018; Glomsrød et al. 2016; Nong 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Chapter 4 

2018; Asakawa et al. 2021). Stringency of carbon constraint is not comparable across the studies. 

Finally, marginal costs of mitigation are not always reported in studies of national mitigation pathways. 
Comparing numbers across countries is not straightforward due to exchange rate fluctuations, differing 
assumptions  by  modellers  in  individual  country  studies,  etc.  The  database  of  national  mitigation 
pathways  assembled  for  this  Report—which  covers  only  a  fraction  of  available  national  mitigation 
studies in the literature—shows that marginal costs of mitigation are positive, with a median value of 
101 USD2010/tCO2 in 2030, 244 in 2040 and 733 in 2050 for median mitigation efforts of 21%, 46% 
and 76% relative to business-as-usual respectively. Marginal costs increase over time along accelerated 
mitigation pathways, as constraints become tighter, with a non-linearity as mitigation reaches 80% of 
reference emissions or more. Dispersion across and within countries is high, even in the near-term but 
increases notably in the mid-term (medium evidence, medium agreement). 

4.2.6.3  Mitigation and employment in the short- and medium-term 
Numerous studies have analysed the potential impact of carbon pricing on labour markets. Chateau et 
al. (2018) and OECD (2017a) find that the implementation of green policies globally (defined broadly 
as  policies  that  internalise  environmental  externalities  through  taxes  and  other  tools,  shifting 
profitability from polluting to green sectors) need not harm total employment, and that the broad skill 
composition (low-, high- and medium-skilled jobs) of emerging and contracting sectors is very similar, 
with the largest shares of job creation and destruction at the lowest skill level. To smoothen the labour 
market  transition,  they  conclude  that  it  may  be  important  to  reduce  labour  taxes,  to  compensate 
vulnerable households, and to provide education and training programs, the latter making it easier for 
labour to move to new jobs. Consistent with this, other studies that simulate the impact of scenarios 
with more or less ambitious mitigation policies (including 100% reliance on renewable energy by 2050) 
find  relatively  small  (positive  or  negative)  impacts  on  aggregate  global  employment  that  are  more 
positive if labour taxes are reduced but encompass substantial losses for sectors and regions that today 
are  heavily  dependent  on  fossil  fuels  (Arndt  et  al.  2013;  Huang  et  al.  2019;  Vandyck  et  al.  2016; 
Jacobson et al. 2019).  Among worker categories, low-skilled workers tend to suffer wage losses as they 
are  more  likely  to  have  to  reallocate,  something  that  can  come  at  a  cost  in  the  form  of  a  wage  cut 
(assuming that workers who relocate are initially less productive than those who already work in the 
sector). The results for alternative carbon revenue recycling schemes point to trade-offs: a reduction in 
labour  taxes  often  leads  to  the  most  positive  employment  outcomes  while  lump-sum  (uniform  per-
capita) transfers to households irrespective of income yield a more egalitarian outcome. 

The  results  from  country-level  studies  using  CGE  models  tend  be  similar  to  those  at  global  level. 
Aggregate employment impacts are small and may be positive especially if labour taxes are cut, see 
e.g., (Telaye et al. 2019) for Ethiopia, (Kolsuz and Yeldan 2017) for Turkey, (Fragkos et al. 2017) for 
the  EU,  (Mu  et  al.  2018b)  for  China.  On  the  other  hand,  sectoral  reallocations  away  from  fossil-
dependent sectors may be substantial, see e.g., (Alton et al. 2014) for South Africa or  (Huang et al. 
2019) for China. Targeting of investment to labour-intensive green sectors may generate the strongest 
employment  gains,  see,  e.g.,  (Perrier  and  Quirion  2018)  for  France,  (van  Meijl  et  al.  2018)  for  the 
Netherlands, (Patrizio et al. 2018) for the USA. Changes in skill requirements between emerging and 
declining sectors appear to be quite similar, involving smaller transitions than during the IT revolution 
(Bowen et al. 2018). 

In sum, the literature suggests that the employment impact of mitigation policies tends to be limited on 
aggregate, but can be significant at the sectoral level (medium evidence, medium agreement) and that 
cutting labour taxes may limit adverse effects on employment (limited evidence, medium agreement). 
Labour market impacts, including job losses in certain sectors, can be mitigated by equipping workers

for job changes via education and training, and by reducing labour taxes to boost overall labour demand 
(Stiglitz et al. 2017) (4.5). 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Like most of the literature on climate change, the above studies do not address gender aspects. These 
may be significant since the employment shares for men and women vary across sectors and countries.  

 Mitigation and equity in the near- and mid-term 

4.2.6.4 
Climate mitigation may exacerbate socio-economic pressures on poorer households (Jakob et al. 2014). 
First,  the  price  increase  in  energy-intensive  goods  and  services—including  food  (Hasegawa  et  al. 
2018)—associated with mitigation may affect poorer households disproportionally (Bento 2013), and 
increase the number of energy-poor (Berry 2019). Second, the mitigation may disproportionally affect 
low-skilled  workers  (see  previous  section).  Distributional  issues  have  been  identified  not  only  with 
explicit price measures (carbon tax, emission permits system, subsidy removal), but also with subsidies 
for renewables (Borenstein and Davis 2016), and efficiency and emissions standards (Davis and Knittel 
2019; Bruegge et al. 2019; Levinson 2019; Fullerton and Muehlegger 2019). 

Distributional implications, however, are context specific, depending on consumption patterns (initially 
and ease of adjusting them in response to price changes) and asset ownership (see for example analysis 
of energy prices in Indonesia by Renner et al.  (2019)). In an analysis of the distributional impact of 
carbon pricing based on household expenditure data for 87 low- and middle-income countries, Dorband 
et  al.    (2019)  find  that,  in  countries  with  a  per-capita  income  of  up  to  USD15,000  per  capita  (PPP 
adjusted),  carbon  pricing  has  a  progressive  impact  on  income  distribution  and  that  there  may  be  an 
inversely U-shaped relationship between energy expenditure shares and per-capita income, rendering 
carbon  pricing  regressive  in  high-income  countries,  i.e.,  in  countries  where  the  capacity  to  pursue 
compensatory policies tends to be relatively strong. 

The  literature  finds  that  the  detailed  design  of  mitigation  policies  is  critical  for  their  distributional 
impacts (robust evidence, high agreement). For example, Vogt-Schilb et al. (2019) suggest to turn to 
cash  transfer  programs,  established  as  some  of  the  most  efficient  tools  for  poverty  reduction  in 
developing countries. In an analysis of Latin America and the Caribbean, they find that allocation of 30 
percent of carbon revenues would suffice to compensate poor and vulnerable households on average, 
leaving the rest for other uses. This policy tool is not only available in countries with relatively high 
per-capita incomes: in Sub-Saharan Africa, where per-capita incomes are relatively low, cash transfer 
programs have been implemented in almost all countries ((Beegle et al. 2018), p. 57), and are found 
central  to  the  success  of  energy  subsidy  reforms  (Rentschler  and  Bazilian  2017).  In  the  same  vein, 
Böhringer  et  al. (2021) finds  that  recycling  of revenues  from  emissions  pricing in  equal  amounts  to 
every  household  appeals  as  an  attractive  strategy  to  mitigate  regressive  effects  and  thereby  make 
stringent climate  policy more  acceptable  on  societal fairness  grounds.  However,  distributional  gains 
from such recycling may come at the opportunity cost of not reaping efficiency gains from reductions 
in the taxes that are most distortionary (Goulder et al. 2019).  

Distributional  concerns  related  to  climate  mitigation  are  also  prevalent  in  developed  countries,  as 
demonstrated, for instance, by France’s recent yellow-vest movement, which was ignited by an increase 
in carbon taxes. It exemplifies the fact that, when analysing the distributional effects of carbon pricing, 
it is not sufficient to consider vertical redistribution (i.e., redistribution between households at different 
incomes  levels  but  also  horizontal  redistribution  (i.e.,  redistribution  between  households  at  similar 
incomes which is due to differences in terms of spending shares and elasticities for fuel consumption). 
Compared  to  vertical  redistribution,  it  is  more  difficult  to  devise  policies  that  effectively  address 
horizontal redistribution (Douenne 2020; Cronin et al. 2019; Pizer and Sexton 2019). However, it has 
been shown ex post that transfer schemes considering income levels and location could have protected 
or  even  improved  the  purchasing  power  of  the  bottom  half  of  the  population  (Bureau  et  al.  2019).

Investments  in  public  transportation  may  reduce  horizontal  redistribution  if  it  makes  it  easier  for 
households  to  reduce fossil  fuel consumption  when  prices  increase  (cf.  Section  4.4.1.5  and  4.4.1.9). 
Similarly, in relation to energy use in housing, policies that encourage investments that raise energy 
efficiency for low-income households may complement or be an alternative to taxes and subsidies as a 
means of simultaneously mitigating and reducing fuel poverty (Charlier et al. 2019). From a different 
angle, public acceptance of the French increase in the carbon tax could also have been enhanced via a 
public information campaign could have raised public acceptance of the carbon tax increase (Douenne 
and Fabre 2020). (See section 4.4.1.8 for a discussion of this and other factors that influence public 
support for carbon taxation.). 

 

4.2.7  Obstacles to accelerated mitigation and how overcoming them amounts to shifts 

in development pathways  

As outlined in Sections 4.2.3, 4.2.4, 4.2.5 and 4.2.6 there is improved understanding since AR5 of what 
accelerated  mitigation  would  entail  in  the  coming  decades.  A  major  finding  is  that  accelerated 
mitigation  pathways  in  the  near-  to  mid-term  appear  technically  and  economically  feasible  in  most 
contexts. Chapter 4, however, cannot stop here. Section 4.2.2 has documented an important policy gap 
for  current  climate  pledges,  and  Cross-Chapter  Box  4  shows  an  even  larger  ambition  gap  between 
current pledges and what would be needed in the near- term to be on pathways consistent with below 
2°C, let alone 1.5°C. In other words, while the implementation of mitigation policies to achieve updated 
NDC  almost  doubles  the  mitigation  efforts,  and  notwithstanding  the  widespread  availability  of  the 
necessary technologies, this doubling of effort merely narrows the gap to pathways consistent with 2°C 
by at most 20%.  

Obstacles  to  the  implementation  of  accelerated  mitigation  pathways  can  be  grouped  in  four  main 
categories (Table 4.10). The first set of arguments can be understood through the lens of cost-benefit 
analysis of decision-makers, as they revolve around the following question: Are costs too high relative 
to benefits? More precisely, are the opportunity costs—in economics terms, what is being forfeited by 
allocating  scarce  resources  to  mitigation—justified  by  the  benefits  for  the  decision-maker  (whether 
individual,  firm,  or  nation)?  This  first  set  of  obstacles  is  particularly  relevant  because  accelerated 
mitigation pathways imply significant effort in the short-run, while benefits in terms of limited warming 
accrue later and almost wholly to other actors. However, as discussed in 3.6 and 4.2.6, mitigation costs 
for  a  given  mitigation  target  are  not  carved  in  stone.  They  strongly  depend  on  numerous  factors, 
including the  way  mitigation  policies  have  been  designed, selected,  and  implemented,  the  processes 
through which markets have been shaped by market actors and institutions, and nature of socially- and 
culturally-determined  influences  on  consumer  preferences.  Hence,  mitigation  choices  that  might  be 
expressed straightforwardly as techno-economic decisions are, at a deeper level, strongly conditioned 
by underlying structures of society.

A second set of likely obstacles in the short-term to accelerated mitigation revolves around undesirable 
distributional  consequences,  within  and  across  countries.  As  discussed  in  4.2.6.3,  the  distributional 
implications of climate policies depend strongly on their design, the way they are implemented, and on 
the context into which they are inserted. Distributional implications of climate policies have both ethics 
and equity dimensions, to determine what is desirable/acceptable by a given society in a given context, 
notably the relative power of different winners and losers to have their interests taken into account, or 
not,  in  the  relevant  decision-making  processes.  Like costs,  distributional  implications  of  accelerated 
mitigation are rooted in the underlying socio-political-institutional structures of a society. 

A third set of obstacles are about technology availability and adoption. Lack of access even to existing 
cost-effective  mitigation  technologies  remains  an  important  issue,  particularly  for  many  developing 
countries,  and  even  in  the  short-term.  Though  it  relates  most  directly  to  techno-economic  costs, 
technology  availability  raises  broader  issues  related  to  the  sociotechnical  systems  within  which 
innovation and adoption are embedded, and issues of technology availability are inherently issues of 
systemic failure (16.3). The underlying legal, economic and social structures of the economy are central 
to the different stages of socio-transition processes (Cross-Chapter Box 12). 

The  last  set  of  obstacles  revolves  around  the  unsuitability  of  existing  structures  to  accelerated 
mitigation. We include here all forms of established structures, material (e.g., physical capital) or not 
(institutions, social norms, patterns of individual behaviour), that are potentially long-lived and limit 
the  implementation  of  accelerated  mitigation  pathways.  Typically,  such  structures  exist  for  reasons 
other than climate change and climate mitigation, including the distribution of power among various 
actors. Modifying them in the name of accelerated climate mitigation thus requires to deal with other 
non-climate issues as well. For example, resolving the landlord-tenant dilemma, an institutional barrier 
to the deployment of energy efficiency in building, opens fundamental questions on private property in 
buildings.

Figure 4.6 Obstacles to mitigation (top panel) and measures to remove these obstacles and enable shift in 

 

development pathways (lower panel) 

 

A common thread in the discussion above is that the obstacles to accelerated mitigation are to a large 
degree  rooted  in  the  underlying  structural  features  of  societies.  As  a  result,  transforming  those 
underlying  structures  can  help  to  remove  those  obstacles,  and  thus  facilitate  the  acceleration  of 
mitigation.  This  remark  is  all  the  more  important  that  accelerated  mitigation  pathways,  while  very 
different  across  countries, all  share three  characteristics: speed  of  implementation,  breadth  of  action 
across all sectors of the economy, and depth of emission reduction achieving more ambitious targets. 
Transforming those underlying structures amounts to shifting a society’s development pathway (Figure 
4.6). In the following Sections 3 and 4, we argue that it is thus necessary to recast accelerated mitigation 
in  the  broader  context  of  shifting  development  pathways,  and  that  doing  so  opens  up  additional 
opportunities to (i)  overcome the obstacles  outlined above, and also  (ii)  combine  climate mitigation 
with other development objectives.

4.3  Shifting Development pathways 

Chapter 4 

4.3.1  Framing of development pathways 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

4.3.1.1  What are development pathways? 
The  term  development  pathway  is  defined  in  various  ways  in  the  literature,  and  these  definitions 
invariably refer to the evolution over time of a society’s defining features. A society’s development 
pathway can be described, analysed, and explained from a variety of perspectives, capturing a range of 
possible  features,  trends,  processes,  and  mechanisms.  It  can  be  examined  in  terms  of  specific 
quantitative  indicators,  such  as  population,  urbanisation  level,  life  expectancy,  literacy  rate,  GDP, 
carbon dioxide emission rate, average surface temperature, etc. Alternately, it can be described with 
reference  to  trends  and  shifts  in  broad  socio-political  or  cultural  features,  such  as  democratisation, 
liberalisation,  colonisation,  globalisation,  consumerism,  etc.  Or,  it  can  be  described  in  a  way  that 
highlights  and  details  a  particular  domain  of  interest;  for  example,  as  an  “economic  pathway”, 
“technological  pathway”,  “demographic  pathway”,  or  others.  Any  such  focused  description  of  a 
pathway is more limited, by definition, than the general and encompassing notion of a development 
pathway. 

Development pathways represent societal evolution over time, and can be assessed retrospectively and 
interpreted in a historical light, or explored prospectively by anticipating and assessing alternative future 
pathways.  Development  pathways,  and  prospective  development  pathways  in  particular,  can  reflect 
societal  objectives,  as  in  “low-emission  development  pathways”,  “climate-resilient  development 
pathways”, “sustainable development pathways”, “inclusive development pathway”, and as such can 
embed normative assumptions or preferences, or can reflect potential dystopian futures to be avoided. 
A national development plan (4.3.2) is a representation of a possible development pathway for a given 
society reflecting its objectives, as refracted through its development planning process. 

One approach for exploring shifts in future development pathways is through scenarios. Some examples 
of scenario exercises in the literature are provided in Table 4.11.

Different narratives of development pathways can have distinct and even competing focuses such as 
economic growth, shifts in industrial structure, technological determinism, and can embody alternative 
framings  of  development  itself  (from  growth  to  well-being,  see  Chapter 5),  and  of  sustainable 
development in particular (see 1.6 and 17.1). Scenario exercises are structured undertakings to explore 
alternative future development pathways, often drawing on stakeholder input and accepting the deep 
and irreducible uncertainty inherent in societal development into the future (Kahane 2019; Schweizer 
and Kriegler 2012; Raskin and Swart 2020). The results of scenario explorations, including modelling 
exercises, thus help clarify the characteristics of a particular future pathway, in light of a particular set 
of assumptions and choice of indicators for assessment. Processes of developing scenarios can inform 
choices by decision makers of various kinds.  

Scenarios  are  useful  to  clarify  societal  objectives,  understand  constraints,  and  explore  future  shifts. 
Scenario  exercises  are  effective  when  they  enable  multi-dimensional  assessment,  and  accommodate 
divergent  normative  viewpoints  (Kowarsch  et  al.  2017).  Such  processes  might  take  into  account 
participants’  explicit and implicit priorities,  values,  disciplinary  backgrounds,  and  world  views.  The 
process of defining and describing a society’s development pathway contributes to the ongoing process 
of understanding, explaining and defining the historical and contemporary meaning and significance of 
a  society.  The  imagination  of  facilitated  stakeholder process  combined  with the  rigour  of modelling 
helps  improve  understanding  of  constraints,  trade-offs,  and  choices.  “Scenario  analysis  offers  a 
structured approach for illuminating the vast range of possibilities. A scenario is a story, told in words 
and  numbers,  describing  the  way  events  might  unfold.  If  constructed  with  rigor  and  imagination, 
scenarios help us to explore where we might be headed, but more, offering guidance on how to act now 
to  direct  the  flow  of  events  toward  a  desirable  future”  (Raskin  et  al.  2002).  Scenario  processes  are 
valuable for the quantitative and qualitative insights they can provide, and also for the role they can 
play in providing a forum and process by which diverse institutions and even antagonistic stakeholders

(Kane and Boulle 2018; Dubash 2021). 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

4.3.1.2  Shifting development pathways 
Development pathways evolve as the result of the countless decisions and actions at all levels of societal 
structure, as well due to the emergent dynamics within and between institutions, cultural norms, socio-
technological systems, and the biogeophysical environment. Society can choose to make decisions and 
take actions with the shared intention of influencing the future development pathway toward specific 
agreed objectives. 

The SDGs provide a lens on diverse national and local development objectives. Humankind currently 
faces  multiple  sustainability  challenges  that  together  present  global  society  with  the  challenge  of 
assessing, deliberating, and attempting to bring about a viable, positive future development pathway. 
Ecological sustainability challenges include reducing GHG emissions, protecting the ozone, controlling 
pollutants  such  as  aerosols  and  persistent  organics,  managing  nitrogen  and  phosphorous  cycles,  etc. 
(Steffen  et  al.  2015),  which  are  necessary  to  address  the  rising  risks  to  biodiversity  and  ecosystem 
services on which humanity depends (IPBES 2019a). Socioeconomic sustainability challenges include 
conflict, persistent poverty and deprivation, various forms of pervasive and systemic discrimination and 
deprivation, and socially corrosive inequality. The global adoption of the SDGs and their underlying 
indicators (United Nations 2018) reflect a negotiated prioritisation of these common challenges.  

Figure  4.7  illustrates  the  process  of  shifting  development  pathways.  The  lines  illustrate  different 
possible development pathways through time, some of which (shown here toward the top of the figure) 
remove  obstacles to  the  adoption  and effective  implementation of  sustainable  development  policies, 
and thus give access to a rich policy toolbox for accelerating mitigation and achieving SDGs. Other 
development pathways (shown here toward the bottom of the figure) do not overcome, or even reinforce 
the obstacles to adopting and effectively implementing sustainable development policies, and thus leave 
decision-makers with more limited policy toolbox (4.2.7; Figure 4.6). A richer tool box enables faster, 
deeper and broader mitigation.  

The  development  pathways  branch  and  branch  again,  signifying  how  a  diversity  of  decision-makers 
(policy makers, organizations, investors, voters, consumers, etc.) are continuously making choices that 
influence which of many potential development pathways society follows. Some of these choices fall 
clearly within the domain of mitigation policy. For example, what level carbon price, if any, should be 
imposed? Should fossil fuel subsidies be removed? Most decisions, of course, fall outside the direct 
domain of mitigation policy. Shifting development pathways toward sustainability involves this broader 
realm  of  choices  beyond  mitigation  policy  per  se,  and  requires  identifying  those  choices  that  are 
important determinants of the existing obstacles to accelerating mitigation and meeting other SDGs. 
Addressing  these  choices  coherently  shifts  the  development  pathway  away  from  a  continuation  of 
existing trends,

Figure 4.7 Shifting development pathways to increased sustainability: Choices by a wide range of actors 
at key decision points on development pathways can reduce barriers and provide more tools to accelerate 

mitigation and achieve other Sustainable Development Goals 

4.3.1.3  Expanding the range of policies and other mitigative options 

Shifting development pathways aims to influence the ultimate drivers of emissions (and development 
generally), such as the systemic and cultural determinants of consumption patterns, the political systems 
and  power  structures  that  govern  decision  making,  the  institutions  and  incentives  that  guide  and 
constrain socio-technical innovation, and the norms and information platforms that shape knowledge 
and discourse, and culture, values and needs (Raskin et al. 2002). These ultimate drivers determine the 
mitigative capacity of a society. 

Decision-makers might usefully consider a broader palette of policies and measures as part of an overall 
strategy to meet climate goals and other sustainable development goals (see 4.3.2; Table 4.12). This is 
consistent  with  the  fact  that  mitigation  is  increasingly  understood  to  be  inseparable  from  broader 
developmental  goals,  which  can  be  facilitated  by  policy  coherence  and  integration  with  broader 
objectives and policies sectorally and societally. This is supported by other observations that mitigation 
measures based on conventional climate policy instruments, such as emissions taxes or permits, price 
incentives such as feed-in tariffs for low-carbon electricity generation, and fuel economy standards, and 
building codes, which aim to influence the proximate drivers of emissions alone will not achieve the 
long-term goals of the Paris Agreement (IPCC 2018a; Rogelj et al. 2016; UNEP 2018; Méjean et al.

2015). An approach of shifting development pathways to increased sustainability (SDPS) broadens the 
scope for mitigation.  

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

4.3.1.4  An approach of SDPS helps manage trade-offs between mitigation and other SDGs. 

Beyond removing structural obstacles to accelerated mitigation, broadening the approach to policies 
that  facilitate  shifts  in  development  pathways  also  helps  manage  the  potential  tradeoffs  between 
mitigation and other development objectives discussed in section 4.2.7. 

Systematic studies of the 17 SDGs have found the interactions among them to be manifold and complex 
(Pradhan et al. 2017; Nilsson et al. 2016; Weitz et al. 2018; Fuso Nerini et al. 2019). Addressing them 
calls  for  interventions  affecting  fundamental,  interconnected,  structural  features  of  global  society 
(International  Panel  on  Social  Progress  2018;  TWI2050  -  The  World  in  2050  2018),  such  as  to  our 
physical  infrastructure  (e.g.,  energy,  water,  industrial,  urban  infrastructure)  (Thacker  et  al.  2019; 
Adshead et al. 2019; Waage et al. 2015; Mansell et al. 2019; Chester 2019), our societal institutions 
(e.g.,  educational, public  health, economic, innovation,  and  political institutions)  (Sachs  et  al.  2019; 
Ostrom  2010;  Kläy  et  al.  2015;  Messner  2015),  and  behavioural  and  cultural  tendencies  (e.g., 
consumption patterns, conventional biases, discriminatory interpersonal and intergroup dynamics, and 
inequitable power structures) (Esquivel 2016; Sachs et al. 2019). These observations imply that attempt 
to  address  each  SDG  in  isolation,  or  as  independent  technical  challenges,  would  be  insufficient,  as 
would incremental, marginal changes. In contrast, effectively addressing the SDGs is likely to mean 
significant  disruption  of  long-standing  trends  and  transformative  progress  to  shift  development 
pathways  to  meet  all  the  SDGs,  including  climate  action,  beyond  incremental  changes  targeted  at 
addressing  mitigation  objectives  in  isolation.  In  other  words,  mitigation  conceived  as  incremental 
change is not enough. Transformational change has implications for equity in its multiple dimensions 
(Leach et al. 2018; Klinsky et al. 2017a; Steffen and Stafford Smith 2013) including just transitions 
(4.5). 

Working Group II examines climate resilient development pathways – continuous processes that imply 
deep  societal  changes  and/or  transformation,  so  as  to  strengthen  sustainable  development,  efforts  to 
eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities while promoting fair and cross-scalar capacities for adaptation 
to global warming and reduction of GHG emissions in the atmosphere. Transformative action in the 
context of CRD specifically concerns leveraging change in the five dimensions of development (people, 
prosperity, partnership, peace, planet) (WGII chapter 18). 

Section  4.3.2  provides  more  details  on  the  way  development  pathways  influence  emissions  and 
mitigative capacity. Section 4.3.3 provides examples of shifts in development pathways, as well as of 
policies  that  might  facilitate  those.  Cross-Chapter  Box  5  details  the  links  between  SDPS  and 
sustainability. 

4.3.2  Implications of development pathways for mitigation and mitigative capacity 

4.3.2.1  Countries have different development priorities 
At the global level, the SDGs adopted by all the United Nations Member States in 2015 are delineated 
with a view to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 
2030.  The  17  SDGs  are  integrated  and  imply  that  development  must  balance  social,  economic  and 
environmental sustainability. 

While all countries share the totality of the SDGs, development priorities differ across countries and 
over time. These priorities are strongly linked to local contexts, and depend on which dimensions of 
improvements in the well-being of people are considered the most urgent.

Development priorities are reflected in the decisions that actors within societies make, such as policy 
choices by governments and parliaments at all levels, votes over competing policy platforms by citizens, 
or selection of issues that non-state actors push for. Multiple objectives range from poverty eradication 
to providing energy access, addressing concerns of inequality, providing education, improving health, 
cleaning air and water, improving connectivity, sustaining growth and providing jobs, among others. 
For example, eradicating poverty and reducing inequality is a key development priority across many 
countries, such as Brazil (Grottera et al. 2017), Indonesia (Irfany and Klasen 2017), India (GoI, 2015), 
South  Africa  (Winkler  2018)  and  other  low-  and  middle-income  countries  (Dorband  et  al.  2019). 
Reducing inequality relates not only to income, but also to other dimensions such as in access to energy 
services (Tait 2017), gender, education, racial and ethnic profiles (Andrijevic et al. 2020), and thereby 
assumes relevance in both developing and developed countries. The development  priorities of many 
poor  countries  and  communities  with  low  capacities  to  adapt,  has  been  focused  more  on  reducing 
poverty,  providing  basic  infrastructure,  education  and  improving  health,  rather  than  on  mitigation 
(Chimhowu et al. 2019). 

4.3.2.2  The nature of national development plans is changing  
Governments  are  increasingly  resorting  to  the  development  of  national  plans  to  build  institutions, 
resources,  and  risk/shock  management  capabilities  to  guide  national  development.  The  number  of 
countries with a national development plan has more than doubled, from about 62 in 2006 (World Bank 
2007)  to  134  plans  published  between  2012  and  2018  (Chimhowu  et  al.  2019).  The  comeback  of 
planning  may  be  linked  to  increased  consideration  given  to  sustainability,  which  is  by  construction 
forward-looking and far ranging, and therefore requires state and civil society to prepare and implement 
plans  at  all  levels  of  governance.  Governments  are  increasingly  engaging  in  the  development  and 
formulation  of  national  plans  in  an  organised,  conscious  and  continual  attempt  to  select  the  best 
available alternatives to achieve specific goals.  

A systematic assessment of 107 national development plans and 10 country case studies provides useful 
insights regarding the type and content of the plans  (Chimhowu et al. 2019). development plans are 
increasingly focusing on mobilising action across multiple actors and multiple dimensions to enhance 
resilience and improve the ability to undertake stronger mitigation actions. Various initiatives such as 
the  World  Summit  for  Children  in  1990;  the  Heavily  Indebted  Poor  Country  initiative  that  started 
offering debt relief in exchange for commitments by beneficiary states to invest in health, education, 
nutrition and poverty reduction in 1996; and push towards Comprehensive Development Frameworks 
seem to have catalysed the development of national actions plans across countries to estimate, measure 
and track investments and progress towards SDGs. 

The most recent development plans also tend to differ from the earlier ones in terms of their approach. 
Complexity  science  has  over  the  years  argued  for  new  forms  of  planning  based  on  contingency, 
behaviour change, adaptation and constant learning (Colander and Kupers 2016; Ramalingam, 2013), 
and  new  plans  have  increasingly  focused  on  increasing  resilience  of  individuals,  organisations  and 
systems (Hummelbrunner and Jones, 2013). Finally, alongside short-term (typically 5 year) plans with 
operational purpose, countries have also expressed visions of their development pathways over longer 
time horizons, via, e.g., Voluntary National Reviews submitted in the context of the UN High Level 
Political Forum on Sustainable Development. 

National development plans are also increasingly more holistic in their approach, linking closely with 
SDGs and incorporating climate action in their agendas. For instance, the Low Carbon Development 
Initiative (LCDI), launched in 2017 by the Government of Indonesia, seeks to identify the development 
policies  that  can  help  Indonesia  achieve  multiple  (social,  economic,  and  environmental)  goals 
simultaneously along with preserving and improving the country’s natural resources (Bappenas 2019).

Likewise, Nepal’s Fifteenth five-year plan recognises the need for climate mitigation and adaptation 
and corresponding access to international finance and technologies. The plan suggests mobilization of 
foreign aid in the climate change domain in line with Nepal’s priorities and its inclusion in the country’s 
climate-friendly development programs as the key opportunities in this regard (Nepal 2020).  

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

China’s  development  plans  have  evolved  over  time  from  being  largely  growth  oriented,  and  geared 
largely towards the objectives of addressing poverty, improving health, education and public well-being 
to also including modernisation of agriculture, industry and infrastructure, new forms of urbanisation 
and a clear intent of focusing on innovation and new drivers of development (Central Compilation & 
Translation  Press  2016).  China’s  14th  Five  Year  Plan  not  only  seeks  to  promote  high  quality 
development in all aspects and focus on strengthening the economy in the global industrial chain, but 
also includes a vision of an ‘ecological civilisation’, which had been developed (CPC-CC 2015) and 
analysed earlier (He 2016; Xiao and Zhao 2017). It seeks to enhance China’s climate pledge to peak 
CO2  emissions  by  2030  and  achieve  carbon  neutrality  by  2060  through  more  vigorous  policies  and 
measures.  Development plans tie in multiple development priorities that evolve and broaden over time 
as societies develop, as exemplified inter alia by the history of development plans in India (Box 4.4).

Box 4.4 India’s national development plan 

 

India’s  initial  national  development  plans  focused  on  improving  the  living  standards  of  its  people, 
increasing  national  income  and  food  self-sufficiency.  Accordingly,  there  was  a  thrust  towards 
enhancing  productivity  of  the  agricultural  and  industrial  sectors.  While  the  main  focus  was  on 
maintaining high economic growth and industrial productivity, poverty eradication, employment and 
inclusive growth remained important priorities. The National Action Plan on Climate Change with 8 
Missions focusing on mitigation as well as adaptation was launched in 2008 integrating climate change 
considerations in planning and decision making (MoEF 2008). The 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17) also 
brought in a focus on sustainability and mentioned the need for faster, sustainable and inclusive growth. 
The National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog) was set up in 2017 replacing the erstwhile 
Planning Commission, with a renewed focus towards bringing innovation, technology, enterprise and 
efficient management together at the core of policy formulation and implementation. However, while 
India has moved away from its Five-Year Plans, decision making is more dynamic, with a number of 
sector specific initiatives and targets focused on integrating sustainability dimensions through a series 
of  policies  and  measures  supporting  resource  efficiency,  improved  energy  access,  infrastructure 
development,  low  carbon  options  and  building  resilient  communities,  among  other  objectives 
(MoEFCCC 2021; MoEFCC 2018; GoI 2015). India’s overall development pathway currently has a 
strong  focus  on  achieving  robust  and  inclusive  growth  to  ensure  balanced  development  across  all 
regions and states and across sectors. There is a thrust on embracing new technologies while fostering 
innovation and upskilling, modernisation of agriculture, improving regional and inter-personal equity, 
bridging the gap between public and private sector performance, by focusing on efficient delivery of 
public services, rooting out corruption and black economy, formalising the economy and expanding the 
tax base, improving the ease of doing business, nursing the stressed commercial banking sector back to 
a  healthy  state,  and  stopping  leakages  through  direct  benefit  transfers,  among  other  measures 
(Government of India 2018; MoEFCCC 2021; GoI 2015).

4.3.2.3  Development pathways shape emissions and capacities to mitigate 
Analysis in the mitigation literature often frames mitigation policy as having development co-benefits, 
the main objective being climate stabilisation. This misses the point that development drives emissions, 
and not vice versa, and it is the overall development approach and policies that determine mitigation 
pathways (Munasinghe 2007). A large body of literature supports the fact that development pathways 
have direct and, just as importantly, indirect implications for GHG emissions (Nakicenovic et al. 2000; 
Winkler 2017b), through multiple channels, such as the nature of economic activity, spatial patterns of 
development, degree of inequality, and population growth. 

Economic structure: Chapter 2 notes that overall, affluence (GDP per capita), economic growth and 
population  growth  have  remained  the  main  upward  drivers  of  CO2  emissions  from  fossil-fuel 
combustion in the past decade, with energy efficiency the main countervailing force (2.4) (Wang and 
Feng 2017; Lin and Liu 2015). A major component of the development pathway of a country is precisely 
the nature of the economic activities on which the country relies (e.g., agriculture and mining, heavy 
industry, services, high-tech products, etc.) as well as the way it articulates its economy with the rest of 
the World (e.g., export-led growth vs. import substitution strategies). Hence, the development pathway 
ultimately drives the underlying structure of the economy, and to a large degree the relationship between 
activity and GHG emissions. 

At country level, however, the picture is more nuanced. Both India and China show signs of relative 
decoupling between GDP and emissions because of structural change (Chen et al. 2018a). Sumabat et 
al. (2016) indicate that economic growth had a negative impact on CO2 emissions in Philippines. Baek 
and Gweisah (2013) find that CO2 emissions tend to drop monotonously as incomes increased. Lantz 
and Feng (2006) also indicate that per capita GDP is not related to CO2 emissions in Canada. Other 
studies  point  to  an  emerging  consensus  that  the  relationship  between  CO2  emissions  and  economic 
indicators  depends  on  the  level  of  development  of  countries  (Nguyen  and  Kakinaka  2019;  Sharma 
2011).  While  some  literature  indicates  that  absolute  decoupling  of  economic  growth  and  GHG 
emissions  has  occurred  in  some  countries  (Le  Quéré  et  al.  2019),  a  larger  systematic  review  found 
limited evidence of this (Haberl et al. 2020).  

Looking  ahead,  choices  about  the  nature  of  economic  activities  are  expected  to  have  significant 
implications for emissions. For example, a development pathway that focuses on enhancing economic 
growth based on manufacturing is likely to lead to very different challenges for mitigation compared to 
one that focuses on services-led growth. (Quéré et al. 2018) find that choices about whether or not to 
export  offshore  oil  in  Brazil  will  have  significant  implications  for  the  country’s  GHG  emissions. 
Similarly, in China, transforming industrial structure towards tertiary sectors (Kwok et al. 2018) and 
restructuring  exports  towards  higher  value-added  products  (Wu  et  al.  2019)  are  expected  to  have 
significant implications for GHG emissions. 

Spatial patterns of development: Chapter 2 notes that rapid urbanisation in developing and transition 
countries leads to increased CO2 emissions, the substantial migration of rural populations to urban areas 
in these countries being the main factor leading to increased levels of income and expenditure of new 
urban dwellers which in turn leads to increased personal carbon footprints and overall emissions (2.4). 
Urbanisation, and more broadly spatial patterns of development, are in turned driven to a large part by 
development  choices,  such  as,  inter  alia,  spatial  provision  of  infrastructure  and  services,  choices 
regarding the agriculture and forestry sector, land-use policies, support to regional/local development, 
among others (World Bank, 2009). For example, Dorin (2017) points out that if agriculture sectors in 
Africa and India follow the same development path that developed countries have followed in the past, 
namely  increased  labour  productivity  through  enlargement  and  robotisation  of  farms,  then

unprecedented emigrations of rural workers towards cities or foreign countries will ensue, with large-
scale social, economic and environmental consequences. Looking ahead, a development pathway that 
encourages concentrated influx of people to large urban centres will lead to very different energy and 
infrastructure consumption patterns than a pathway that prioritises the development  of smaller, self-
contained towns and cities. 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Degree of inequality: Chapter 2 notes that while eradicating extreme poverty and providing universal 
access to modern energy services to poor populations across the globe has negligible implications for 
emissions growth, existing studies on the role of poverty and inequality as drivers of GHG emissions 
provide limited  evidence  that under  certain contexts greater inequality  can lead  to  a  deterioration in 
environmental quality and may be associated with higher GHG emissions (2.4). In fact, factors affecting 
household  consumption  based  emissions  include  household  size,  age,  education  attainment, 
employment status, urban vs rural location and housing stock (Druckman and Jackson 2015). There is 
evidence to indicate that at the household level, the increase in emissions from additional consumption 
of  the  lower  income  households  could  be  larger  than  the  reduction  in  emissions  from  the  drop  in 
consumption from the high income households (Sager 2019). Accordingly, as countries seek to fulfil 
the objective of reducing inequality, there are possibilities of higher increase in emissions (Sager 2019).  

Since reducing inequality, as noted above, is globally one of the main development priorities, a large 
body of literature focuses on the compatibility of climate change mitigation and reduction in economic 
inequality (Berthe and Elie 2015; Grunewald et al. 2017; Hao et al. 2016; Wiedenhofer et al. 2017; 
Auffhammer and Wolfram 2014; Baek and Gweisah 2013). However, the use of narrow approaches or 
simple  methods  of  studying  the  relationships  of  income  inequality  and  emissions  by  looking  at 
correlations, may miss important linkages. For example, the influence of inequality on social values 
such  as  status  and  civic  mindedness  and  non-political  interests  that  shape  environmental  policy  can 
influence  overall  consumption  and  its  environmental  impacts  (Berthe  and  Elie  2015).  Moreover, 
inequalities may also be reflected in gender, education, racial and ethnic profiles and could accordingly 
be associated with the level of emissions and mitigation prospects (Andrijevic et al. 2020).  

The  Illustrative  Mitigation  Pathways  (IMP)  developed  for  this  Report  (Box  3.1  and  section  3.2.5) 
provide  another  example  of  how  development  pathways  influence  mitigative  capacity.  Precisely, 
IMP1.5-SP (Shifting Pathways) and 1.5-Ren (Renewables) lead to the same long-term temperature, but 
differ  in  underlying  socio-economic  conditions.  The  former  is  based  on  Shared  Socio-economic 
Pathway (SSP) 1 (sustainable development), whereas the latter is based on SSP 2 (middle of the road). 
Comparing 1.5-Ren to 1.5-SP can thus be interpreted as a numerical translation of trying the reach the 
same  long-term  temperature  goal  without  and  with  shifting  development  pathways  towards 
sustainability. Data shows that the global price of carbon necessary to remain on target is 40%-50% 
lower  in  the  latter  relative  to  the  former,  thus  indicating  that  mitigation  is  cheaper  with  a  shift  in 
development pathway towards sustainability. Other cost indicators (e.g. consumption loss or GDP loss) 
tell the same story. Since both IMPs were computed using the same underlying model, the comparison 
is even more robust.   

In  sum,  development  pathways  can  lead  to  different  emission  levels  and  different  capacities  and 
opportunities to mitigate (medium evidence, high agreement). Thus, focusing on shifting development 
pathways can lead to larger systemic sustainability benefits. 

4.3.2.4 

Integrating  mitigation  considerations  requires  non-marginal  shifts  in  development 
pathways 

Concerns  about  mitigation  are  already  being  introduced  in  national  development  plans,  as  there  is 
evidence that development strategies and pathways can be carefully designed so as to align towards 
multiple priorities and achieve greater synergistic benefits. For example, India’s solar programme is a

key element in its NDC that can in the long run, not only provide energy security and contribute to 
mitigation,  but  can  simultaneously  contribute  to  economic  growth,  improved  energy  access  and 
additional employment opportunities, if appropriate policies and measures are carefully planned and 
implemented. However, the environmental implications of the transition need to be carefully examined 
with regard to the socio-economic implications in light of the potential of other alternatives like green 
hydrogen, nuclear or CCUS. Similarly, South Africa National Development Plan (2011) also integrates 
transition to low-carbon as part of the country development objectives (Box 4.5). 

 

START BOX 4.5 HERE 
 

Box 4.5 South Africa’s National Development Plan 

South Africa adopted its first National Development Plan (NDP) in 2011 (NPC 2011), the same year in 
which the country adopted climate policy (RSA 2011) and hosted COP17 in Durban. Chapter 5 of the 
NDP addresses environmental sustainability in the context of development planning, and specifically 
“an equitable transition to a low-carbon economy” (NPC 2011). The chapter refers explicitly to the need 
for  a  just  transition,  protecting  the  poor  from  impacts  and  any  transitional  costs  from  emissions-
intensive to low-carbon. The plan proposes several mitigation measures, including a carbon budgeting 
approach,  reference  to  Treasury’s  carbon  tax,  use  of  various  low  carbon  options  while  maintaining 
energy  security,  and  the  integrated  resource  plan  for  electricity.  The  NDP  refers  to  coal  in  several 
chapters, in some places suggesting additional investment (including new rail lines to transport coal and 
coal  to  liquids),  in  others  decommissioning  coal-fired  power  “Procuring  at  least  20  000MW  of 
renewable electricity by 2030, importing electricity from the region, decommissioning 11 000MW of 
ageing coal-fired power stations and stepping up investments in energy-efficiency” (NPC 2011: p.46). 
Reference to environmental sustainability is not limited to chapter 5 – the introductory vision statement 
includes acknowledgement “that each and every one of us is intimately and inextricably of this earth 
with its beauty and life-giving sources; that our lives on earth are both enriched and complicated by 
what we have contributed to its condition” (NPC 2011: p. 21); and the overview of the plan includes a 
section on climate change, addressing both mitigation and adaptation. 

END BOX 4.5 HERE 

 

Looking  ahead,  given  that  different  development  pathways  can  lead  to  different  levels  of  GHG 
emissions and to different capacities and opportunities to mitigate, there is increasing research on how 
to make development pathways more sustainable. Literature is also focusing on the need for a “new 
normal” as a system capable of achieving higher quality growth while addressing multiple development 
objectives by focusing on “innovative development pathways”.  

Literature  suggests  that  if  development  pathways  are  to  be  changed  to  address  the  climate  change 
problem,  choices  that  would  need  to  be  made  about  development  pathways  would  not  be  marginal 
(Stern and Professor 2009), and would require a new social contract to address a complex set of inter-
linkages  across  sectors,  classes  and  the  whole  economy  (Winkler  2017b).  Shifting  development 
pathways necessitates planning in a holistic manner, rather than thinking about discrete and isolated 
activities and actions to undertake mitigation. Further, the necessary transformational changes can be 
positive if they are rooted in the development aspirations of the economy and society in which they take 
place  (Dubash  2012;  Jones  et  al.  2013),  but  they  can  also  lead  to  carbon  colonialism  if  the 
transformations are imposed by Northern donors or perceived as such.

Accordingly, influencing a societies’ development pathways draws upon a broader range of policies 
and  other  efforts  than  narrowly  influencing  mitigation  pathways,  to  be  able  to  achieve  the  multiple 
objectives  of  reducing  poverty,  inequality  and  GHG  emissions.  The  implications  for  employment, 
education, mobility, housing and many other development aspects must be integrated and new ways of 
looking  at  development  pathways  which  are  low  carbon  must  be  considered  (Bataille  et  al.  2016b; 
Waisman et al. 2019). For instance, job creation and education are important elements that could play 
a key role in reducing inequality and poverty in countries like South Africa and India (Rao and Min 
2018; Winkler et al. 2015) while these also open up broader opportunities for mitigation. 

4.3.2.5  New tools are needed to pave and assess development pathways 
Relative  to  the  literature  on  mitigation  pathways  described  in  4.2.5  and  in  4.3.3,  the  literature  on 
development pathways is limited. The climate research community has developed the Shared Socio-
economic  pathways  (SSPs)  that  link  several  socio-economic  drivers  including  equity  in  relation  to 
welfare, resources, institutions, governance and climate mitigation policies in order to reflect many of 
the  key  development  directions  (O’Neill  et  al.  2014).  In  most  modelling  exercises  however, 
development  remains  treated  as  an  exogenous  input.  In  addition,  models  may  capture  only  some 
dimensions of development that are relevant for mitigation options, thereby not capturing distributional 
aspects and not allowing consistency checks with broader developmental goals (Valadkhani et al. 2016). 
Quantitative  tools  for  assessing  mitigation  pathways  could  be  more  helpful  if  they  could  provide 
information  on  a  broader  range  of  development  indicators,  and  could  model  substantively  different 
alternative development paths, thereby providing information on which levers might shift development 
in a more sustainable direction. 

Doing  so  requires  new  ways  of  thinking  with  interdisciplinary  research  and  use  of  alternative 
frameworks and methods suited to deeper understanding of change agents, determinants of change and 
adaptive  management  among  other  issues  (Winkler  2018).  This  includes,  inter  alia,  being  able  to 
examine  enabling  conditions  for  shifting  development  pathways  (see  4.4.1);  re-evaluating  the  neo-
classical assumptions within most models, both on the functioning of markets and on the behaviour of 
agents,  to  better  address  obstacles  on  the  demand  side,  obstacles  on  the  supply  side  and  market 
distortions  (Ekholm  et  al.  2013;  Staub-Kaminski  et  al.  2014;  Grubb  et  al.  2015)  improving 
representation of issues related with uncertainty, innovation, inertia and irreversibility within the larger 
development contexts, including energy access and security ; improving the representation of social and 
human capital, and of social, technological and governance innovations (Pedde et al. 2019). 

Tools have been developed in that direction, for example in the Mitigation Action Plans and Scenarios 
(MAPS)  community  (La  Rovere  et  al.  2014b),  but  need  to  be  further  mainstreamed  in  the  analysis. 
Back-casting  is  often  a  preferred  modelling  approach  for  assessment  aiming  to  align  national 
development  goals  with  global  climate  goals  like  CO2  stabilisation.  Back-casting  is  a  normative 
approach  where  modellers  construct  desirable  futures  and  specify  upfront  targets  and  then  find  out 
possible pathways to attain these targets (IPCC et al. 2001). Use of approaches like back-casting are 
useful not only in incorporating the long term national development objectives in the models, but also 
evaluating conflicts and synergies more effectively (van der Voorn et al. 2020). In back casting, the 
long-term national development objectives remain the key benchmarks guiding the model dynamics 
and  the  global  climate  goal  is  interfaced  to  realise  the  co-benefits.  The  models  then  delineate  the 
roadmap  of  national  actions  such  that  the  national  goals  are  achieved  with  a  comprehensive 
understanding of the full costs and benefits of low carbon development (often including the costs of 
adaptation  and  impacts  from  residual  climate  change).  Back-casting  modelling  exercises  show  that 
aligning development and climate actions could result in much lower ‘social cost of carbon’ (Shukla et 
al. 2008). Back-casting does not aim to produce blueprints. Rather, it indicates the relative feasibility 
and the social, environmental, and political implications of different development and climate futures

on  the  assumption  of  a clear  relationship  between  goal  setting and  policy  planning  (Dreborg  1996). 
Accordingly, back-casting exercises are well suited for preparing local specific roadmaps like for cities 
(Gomi et al. 2011, 2010).

4.3.3  Examples of shifts in development pathways and of supporting policies 

As noted in 4.3.1, policy approaches that include a broader range of instruments and initiatives would 
impact  more  fundamentally  on  the  actors,  institutions  and  structures  of  societies  and  the  dynamics 
among them, aiming to alter the underlying drivers of emissions, opening up a wider range of mitigation 
opportunities and potential in the process of achieving societal development goals. While the evolution 
of these drivers is subject to varied influences and complex interactions, there are policy measures by 
which decision-makers might influence them. Table 4.12 provides some examples of policy measures 
that can affect key drivers (shown in the row headings).

Policies such as those listed in Table 4.12 are typically associated with broader objectives than GHG 
mitigation.  They  are  generally  conceived  and  implemented  in  the  pursuit  of  overall  societal 
development objectives, such as job creation, macro-economic stability, economic growth, and public 
health and welfare. However, they can have major influence on mitigative capacity, and hence can be 
seen as necessary tools if mitigation options are to be significantly broadened and accelerated (medium 
evidence,  medium  agreement).  The  example  of  the  UK  shows  how  accelerated  mitigation  through 
dietary  changes  require  a  wide  set  of  efforts  to  shift  underlying  drivers  of  behaviour.  In  this  case, 
multiple forces have interacted to lead to reduced meat consumption, including health attitudes, animal 
welfare  concerns,  and  an  increasing  focus  on  climate  and  other  environmental  impacts  of  livestock 
production, along with corporate investment in market opportunities, and technological developments 
in meat alternatives (Box 5.5).

Other historic cases that are unrelated to recent mitigation efforts might be more appropriate examples 
of  major  socio-technical  shifts  that  were  largely  driven  by  intentional,  coherent  intentional  policy 
initiatives across numerous domains to meet multiple objectives. The modernization of agriculture in 
various national contexts fits such a mold. In the US, for example, major government investments in 
agricultural  innovation  through  the  creation  of  agricultural  universities  and  support  for  research 
provided advances in the technological basis for modernization. A network of agricultural extension 
services accelerated the popularization and uptake of modern methods. Infrastructure investments in 
irrigation and drainage made production more viable, and investment in roadways and rail for transport 
supported market formation. Agricultural development banks made credit available, and government 
subsidies improved the profitability for farmers and agricultural corporations. Public campaigns were 
launched to modify food habits (Ferleger 2000).  

Further examples of SDPS across many different systems and sectors are elaborated across this report. 
Concrete  examples  assessed  in  this  Chapter  include  high  employment  and  low  emissions  structural 
change, fiscal reforms for mitigation and social contract, combining housing policies to deliver both 
housing and transport mitigation, and change economic, social and spatial patterns of development of 
the agriculture sector provide the basis for sustained reductions in emissions from deforestation (4.4.1.7-
4.4.1.10).  These  examples  differ  by  context.  Examples  in  other  chapters  include  transformations  in 
energy, urban, building, industrial, transport, and land-based systems, changes in behaviour and social 
practices,  as  well  as  transformational changes  across whole economies  and  societies  (Cross  Chapter 
Box 5, 5.8, Box 6.2, 8.2, 8.3.1, 8.4, 9.8.1, 9.8.2, 10.4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 12}. These examples and 
others can be understood in the context of an explanation of the concept of SDPS, and how to shifting 
development pathways (Cross-Chapter Box 5).

1. What do we mean by development pathways? 
In the present report, development pathways refer to patterns of development resulting from multiple 
decisions and choices made by many actors in the national and global contexts. Each society whether 
in  the  Global  North  or  the  Global  South  follows  its  own  pattern  of  development  (Figure 1.6). 
Development pathways can also be described at smaller scales (e.g., for regions or cities). By extension, 
the concept can also be applied to sectors and systems (e.g., the development pathway of the agricultural 
sector or of industrial systems).

2a. Past development pathways determine both today’s GHG emissions and the set of opportunities 
to reduce emissions 
 
Development pathways drive GHG emissions for a large part (2.4, 2.5 and 2.6). For example, different 
social choices and policy packages with regard to land use and associated rents will result in human 
settlements with different spatial patterns, different types of housing markets and cultures, and different 
degrees  of  inclusiveness,  and  thus  different  demand  for  transport  services  and  associated  GHG 
emissions (8.3.1, 10.2.1). 
 
There is compelling evidence to show that continuing along existing development pathways is unlikely 
to  achieve  rapid  and  deep  emission  reductions  (robust  evidence,  medium  agreement).  For  example, 
investments in long-lived infrastructure, including energy supply systems, could lock-in high emissions 
pathways and risk making deep decarbonisation and sustainable policies more difficult and expensive. 
Development pathways also determine the set of tools available to mitigate climate change (Figure 4.7). 
For example, the capacity of households to move closer to their workplace, in response to, e.g., a price 
signal  on  carbon  and  thus  on  gasoline,  depends  on  rents,  which  themselves  depend  on  the  spatial 
patterns of development of human settlements (8.3.1). Said differently, mitigation costs depend on past 
development choices. Similarly, development pathways determine the enablers and levers available for 
adaptation (WGII, Chapter 18) and for achieving other SDGs. 
 
In  the  absence  of  shifts  in  development  pathways,  conventional  mitigation  policy  instruments  (e.g., 
carbon tax, emission quotas, technological norms, etc.) may not be able to limit emissions to a degree 
sufficient for deep decarbonisation or only at very high economic and social costs. 
 
Policies to shift development pathways, on the contrary, make mitigation policies more effective. For 
example, policies that prioritise non-car transit, or limit rents close to work places would make it easier 
for households to relocate in response to a price signal on transport, and thus makes the same degree of 
mitigation achievable at lower economic and social cost. 
 
2b. Shifting development pathways broadens the scope for synergies between development objectives 
and mitigation 
Second, societies pursue a variety of development objectives, of which protecting the Earth’s climate 
is part. The SDGs provide a global mapping of these goals. Absent climate mitigation, our collective 
ability to achieve the SDGs in 2030 and to sustain them beyond 2030 is likely to be compromised, even 
if adaptation measures are put in place (WGII). 
 
There are many instances in which reducing GHG emissions and moving towards the achievement of 
other development objectives can go hand in hand, in the near-, mid- and long-term (3.7, 6.7.7, 7.6.5, 
8.2, 9.8, 10.1.1, 11.5.3, 17.3) (Figures 3.40, 12.1). For example, transitions from coal-based power to 
lower-emissions  electricity  generation  technologies  and  from  Internal  Combustion  Engine  to  lower-
carbon transport has large mitigation potential and direct benefits for health through reduction in local 
air pollution (Box 6.2, 10.4.1). Energy efficiency in buildings and energy poverty alleviation through 
improved access to clean fuels also delivers significant health benefits (9.8.1 and 9.8.2).  
 
Careful design of mitigation policies is critical to achieving these synergies (13.8). Integrated policies 
can support the creation of synergies between climate change goals and other SDGs. For example, when 
measures  promoting  walkable  urban  areas  are  combined  with  electrification  and  clean  renewable 
energy, there are several co-benefits to be attained (5.2, Figure SPM.8). These include reduced pressures

on agricultural land from reduced urban growth, health co-benefits from cleaner air and benefits from 
enhanced mobility (8.2; 8.4; 4.4.1.9).  
 
Policy design can also manage trade-offs, for example through policy measures as part of just transitions 
(17.4). However, even with good policy design, decisions about mitigation actions, and the timing and 
scale thereof, may entail trade-offs with the achievement of other national development objectives in 
the near-, mid- and long-term. In the near-term, for example, regulations may ban vehicles from city 
centres to reduce congestion and local air pollution, but reduce mobility and choice. Increasing green 
spaces within cities without caps on housing prices may involve trade-offs with affordable housing and 
push low income residents outside the city (8.2.2). In the mid- and long-term, large-scale deployment 
of biomass energy raises concerns about food security and biodiversity conservation (3.7.1, 3.7.5, 7.4.4, 
9.8.1,  12.5.2,  12.5.3).  Conflicts  between  mitigation  and  other  development  objectives  can  act  as  an 
impediment to climate action (13.8). Climate change is the result of decades of unsustainable energy 
production, land-use, production and consumption patterns, as well as governance arrangements and 
political economic institutions that lock in resource-intensive development patterns (robust evidence, 
high  agreement).  Reframing  development  objectives  and  shifting  development  pathways  towards 
sustainability  can  help  transform  these  patterns  and  practices,  allowing  space  for  transitions 
transforming  unsustainable  systems  (medium  evidence,  high  agreement)  (Chapter  17  Executive 
Summary). 
 
Prioritising is one way to manage trade-offs, addressing some national development objectives earlier 
than others. Another way is to adopt policy packages aimed at shifting development pathways towards 
sustainability  as  they  expand  the  range  of  tools  available  to  simultaneously  achieve  multiple 
development  objectives,  including  mitigation.  In  the  city  example  of  section  2a,  a  carbon  tax  alone 
would run counter to other development objectives if it made suburban households locked into high 
emissions transport modes poorer or if it restricted mobility choices, in particular for low- and middle-
income households. Policy packages combining affordable housing and provision of safe low-carbon 
mobility  could  both  facilitate  equitable  access  to  housing  (a  major  development  objective  in  many 
countries) and make it easier to mitigate by shifting the urban development pathway. 
 
Similarly, a fundamental shift in the service provision that helps reduce energy demand (Chapter 5), 
driven  by  targeted  policies,  investment  and  enabling  socio-cultural  and  behavioural  change,  would 
reduce  pressure  on  supply  side  mitigation  need,  hence  limiting  pressure  on  water  and  food  and  the 
achievement of associated SDGs. Some studies assume Western European lifestyle as a reference for 
the  global  North  and  an  improvement  in  the  living  standard  for  the  Global  South  to  reduce  energy 
demand and emissions (e.g., (Grubler et al. 2018)), while others explore a transformative change in the 
global North to achieve a decent living standard for all (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020; Bertram et al. 
2018) (3.7.8). For example, in the UK, interaction between multiple behavioural, socio-cultural, and 
corporate drivers including NGO campaigns, social movements and product innovations resulted in an 
observed decline in meat consumption (5.4, 5.6.4).  
 
3. What does shifting development pathways towards sustainability entail? 
Shifting  development  pathways  towards  sustainability  implies  making  transformative  changes  that 
disrupt existing developmental trends. Such choices would not be marginal (Stern and Professor 2009), 
but  include  technology  adoption,  infrastructure  availability  and  use,  and  socio-behavioural  factors 
(Chapter 5).

These  include  creating  new  infrastructure,  sustainable  supply  chains,  institutional  capacities  for 
evidence-based  and  integrated  decision-making,  financial  alignment  towards  low-carbon  socially 
responsible investments, just transitions and shifts in behaviour and norms to support shifts away from 
fossil-fuel consumption (Green and Denniss 2018). Adopting multi-level governance modes, tackling 
corruption where it inhibits shifts to sustainability, and improving social and political trust are also key 
for aligning and supporting long-term environmentally just policies and processes. 
 
Shifting  development  pathways  entails  fundamental  changes  in  energy,  urban,  building,  industrial, 
transport,  and  land-based  systems.  It  also  requires  changes  in  behaviour  and  social  practices. 
Overcoming inertia and locked-in practices may face considerable opposition (5.4.5) (Geels et al. 2017). 
The durability of carbon intensive transport modes and electricity generating infrastructures increase 
the risk of lock-in to high emissions pathways, as these comprise not just consumer practices, but sunk 
costs in infrastructure, supporting institutions and rules (Seto et al. 2016; Mattioli et al. 2020). Shifting 
investments towards low-GHG solutions requires a combination of conducive public policies, attractive 
investment opportunities, as well as the availability of financing to enable such a transition (15.3). 
 
4. How to shift development pathways? 
Shifting development paths is complex. If history is any guide, practices that can easily supplant existing 
systems  and  are  clearly  profitable  move  fastest  (Griliches  1957).  Changes  that  involve  ‘dissimilar, 
unfamiliar and more complex science-based components’ take more time, acceptance and legitimation 
and  involve  complex  social  learning  (Conley  and  Udry  2010),  even  when  they  promise  large  gains 
(Pezzoni et al. 2019). 
 
Yet despite the complexities of the interactions that result in patterns of development, history also shows 
that societies can influence the direction of development pathways based on choices made by decision-
makers,  citizens,  the  private  sector  and  social  stakeholders.  For  example,  fundamentally  different 
responses  to  the  first  oil  shock  shifted  then-comparable  economies  on  to  different  energy  sector 
development and economic pathways in the 1970s and 80s (Sathaye et al. 2009). More recent examples 
have shown evidence of voluntary transitions for e.g., advanced lighting in Sweden, improved cook-
stoves in China, liquefied petroleum gas stoves in Indonesia or ethanol vehicles in Brazil  (Sovacool 
2016).  
 
There is no one-size-fits-all recipe for shifting development pathways. However, the following insights 
can be drawn from past experience and scenarios of possible future development pathways (4.4.1). For 
example, policies making inner-urban neighbourhoods more accessible and affordable reduce transport 
costs for low- and middle-income households, and also reduce transport emissions (4.4.1.9). Shifts in 
development  pathways  result  from  both  sustained  political  interventions  and  bottom-up  changes  in 
public opinion. No single sector or policy action is enough to achieve this. Coordinated policy mixes 
would need to coordinate multiple actors – i.e., individuals, groups and collectives, corporate actors, 
institutions  and  infrastructure  actors  –  to  deepen  decarbonisation  and  shift  pathways  towards 
sustainability (Pettifor 2020). One example was the LPG Subsidy ("Zero Kero") Program in Indonesia 
which  harnessed  creative  policy  design  to  shift  to  cleaner  energy  by  overcoming  existing  private 
interests. The objective of decreasing fiscal expenditures on domestic kerosene subsidies by replacing 
it  with  LPG  was  achieved  by  harnessing  distribution  networks  of  existing  providers  supported  by 
government subsidized provision of equipment and subsidized pricing (Cross-Chapter Box 9). 
  
Shifts in one country may spill over to other countries. Collective action by individuals as part of formal 
social movements or informal lifestyle changes underpins system change (5.2.3, 5.4.1, 5.4.5.3, 13.5).

Sectoral transitions that aspire to shift development pathways often have multiple objectives, and deploy 
a  diverse  mix  or  package  of  policies  and  institutional  measures  (Figure  13.6).  Context  specific 
governance conditions can significantly enable or disable sectoral transitions, and play a determinative 
role  in  whether  a  sectoral  transition  leads  to  a  shift  in  development  pathway.  For  example,  if 
implemented policies to tackle fuel poverty target the most socially vulnerable households, this can help 
address barriers poor households face in undertaking building retrofits. In the EU-28, it has been shown 
that  accelerated  energy  efficiency  policies  coupled  with  strong  social  policies  targeting  the  most 
vulnerable households, can help reduce the energy demand in residential sector, and deliver additional 
co-benefits of avoided premature deaths and reduced health impacts (9.8.2). 
 
Literature suggests that through equitable resource distribution, high levels of human development can 
be provided at moderate energy and carbon levels by changing consumption patterns and redirecting 
systems in the direction of more sustainable resource use, suggesting that a special effort can be made 
in  the  near  term  for  those  on  higher  incomes  who  account  for  a  disproportionate  fraction  of  global 
emissions (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020; Hickel et al. 2021) (5.2.2, Figure 5.14). 
 
The necessary transformational changes are likely to be more acceptable if rooted in the development 
aspirations of the economy and society within which they take place (Jones et al. 2013; Dubash 2012) 
and may enable a new social contract to address a complex set of inter-linkages across sectors, classes 
and the whole economy (Fleurbaey et al. 2018). 
 
Taking advantage of windows of opportunity and disruptions to mindsets and socio-technical systems 
could advance deeper transformations. These might include the globally declining costs of renewables 
(Fig.1.7, 2.2.5, Box 16.2), emerging social norms for climate mitigation (Green and Denniss 2018), or 
the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which might be harnessed to centre political action on protecting human 
and planetary health (Büchs et al. 2020), but if not handled carefully could also risk to undermine the 
support for transformation. 
 
5. How can shifts in development pathways be implemented by actors in different contexts? 
Shifting development pathways to increased sustainability is a shared aspiration. Yet since countries 
differ in starting points (e.g., social, economic, cultural, political) and history, they have different urgent 
needs  in  terms  of  facilitating  the  economic,  social,  and  environmental  dimensions  of  sustainable 
development and, therefore, give different priorities (4.3.2, 17.4). The appropriate set of policies to shift 
development pathways thus depends on national circumstances and capacities. 
 
In  some  developed  countries  and  communities,  affluence  leads  to  high  levels  of  consumption  and 
emissions across sectors (Wiedmann et al. 2020; Mazur and Rosa 1974). For some countries, reducing 
consumption can reduce emissions without compromising on wellbeing. However, some developing 
countries  still  face  the  challenge  of  escaping  “middle-income  traps”  (Agénor  and  Canuto  2015),  as 
labour-saving  technological  change  and  globalisation  have  limited  options  to  develop  via  the 
manufacturing  sector  (Altenburg  and  Rodrik  2017).  In  least  developed  countries,  infrastructure, 
industry, and public services are still being established, posing both a challenge to financial support to 
deploy  technologies,  and  large  opportunities  to  support  accelerating  low-to-zero  carbon  options 
(especially in terms of efficient and sufficient provision, (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020)). Availability 
of  capital,  or  lack  thereof,  is  a  critical  discriminant  across  countries  and  requires  international 
cooperation (15.2.2).

Shifting development pathways towards sustainability needs to be supported by global partnerships to 
strengthen suitable capacity, technological innovation (16.6), and financial flows (14.4.1, 15.2.4). The 
international  community  can  play  a  particularly  key  role  by  helping  ensure  the  necessary  broad 
participation  in  climate-mitigation  efforts,  including  by  countries  at  different  development  levels, 
through  sustained  support  for  policies  and  partnerships  that  support  shifting  development  pathways 
towards  sustainability  while  promoting  equity  and  being  mindful  of  different  transition  capacities 
(4.3.2, 16.5, 16.6, 14.4, 17.4). 
 
END CCB 5 HERE 

 
In  sum,  development  pathways  unfold  over  time  in  response  to  complex  dynamics  among  various 
drivers and diverse actors with varying interests and motivations (high agreement, robust evidence). 
The way countries develop determines the nature and degree of the obstacles to accelerating mitigation 
and achieving other sustainable development objectives (medium-robust evidence, medium agreement). 
Meeting ambitious mitigation and development goals cannot be achieved through incremental change 
(robust  evidence,  medium  agreement).  Shifting  development  pathways  thus  involves  designing  and 
implementing policies where possible to intentionally enhance enabling conditions and reduce obstacles 
to desired outcomes (medium evidence, medium agreement). 

Section  4.4  elaborates  mechanisms  through  which  societies  can  develop  and  implement  policies  to 
substantially  shift  development  pathways  toward  securing  shared  societal  objectives.  Such  policies 
entail overcoming obstacles (see 4.2.7) by means of favourable enabling conditions: governance and 
institutions,  behaviour,  innovation,  policy  and  finance.  These  enabling  conditions  are  amenable  to 
intentional change – to greater or lesser degrees and over longer or shorter time scales – based on a 
range of possible measures and processes (see section 4.4). 

 

4.4  How to shift development pathways and accelerate the pace and scale 

of mitigation 

4.4.1  Approaches, enabling conditions and examples 

4.4.1.1  Framing the problem 
What  have  we  learned  so  far?  As  highlighted  above,  despite  30  years  of  UNFCCC  and  growing 
contributions  by  non-state  actors,  the  emissions  gap  keeps  growing  (4.2.2  and  4.2.3).  Mitigation 
conceived as incremental change is not enough. Meeting ambitious mitigation goals entails rapid, non-
marginal changes in production and consumption patterns (4.2.4 and 4.2.5). Taking another approach, 
we have seen in section 4.3 that shifting development pathways broadens the scope for mitigation (4.3.1, 
4.3.2) and offers more opportunities than mitigation alone to combine mitigation with the realisation of 
other SDGs (4.3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 5).  

A  practical  way  forward  is  to  combine  shifting  development  pathways  and  accelerating  mitigation 
(medium  evidence,  high  agreement).  This  means  introducing  multi-objective  policy  packages  and 
sequences with climate and development components that both target mitigation directly and create the 
conditions for shifts in development pathways that will help accelerate further mitigation down the line, 
and meet other development objectives. Since development pathways result from a myriad of decisions 
from multiple actors (4.3.1), coordination across countries and with non-state actors is essential.

The literature does not provide a handbook on how to accomplish the above. However, analysis of past 
experience as well as understanding of how societies function yield insights that the present section 
aims at presenting. Human history has seen multiple transformation of economies due to path-breaking 
innovations  (Michaelowa  et  al.  2018),  like  the  transformation  of  the  energy  system  from traditional 
biomass to fossil fuels  or from  steam to  electricity  (Fouquet  2010,  2016a;  Sovacool  2016).  Fouquet 
(2016b)  and  Smil  (2016)  argue  that  even  the  most  rapid  global  transformations  have  taken  several 
decades.  Enabling  transformational  change  implies  to  create  now  the  conditions  that  lead  to  that 
transformation (Díaz et al. 2019). The starting point is that there is no single factor determining such a 
transformation.  Rather  a  range  of  enabling  conditions  can  combine  in  a  co-evolutionary  process. 
Amongst the conditions that have been cited in the literature are higher levels of innovation, multilevel 
governance, transformative policy regimes or profound behavioural transformation (IPCC 2018a; Geels 
et al. 2018; Kriegler et al. 2018; Rockström et al. 2017). It might be possible to put in place some of the 
above conditions rapidly, while others may take longer, thereby requiring an early start. 

The present chapter uses the set of enabling conditions identified in the IPCC  SR1.5 report, namely 
policy,  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  finance,  behaviour  and  lifestyles  and  innovation  and 
technology (de Coninck et al. 2018). As Figure 4.8 illustrates, public policies are required to foster both 
accelerating mitigation and shifting development pathways. They are also vital to guide and provide the 
other enabling conditions (cf. Table 4.12). Improved governance and enhanced institutional capacity 
facilitate the adoption of policies that accelerate mitigation and shift development pathways, with the 
potential  to  achieve  multiple  mitigation  and  development  objectives.  Finance  is  required  both  to 
accelerate mitigation and to shift development pathways. Chapter 15 argues that near-term actions to 
shift the financial system over the next decade (2021-2030) are critically important and feasible, and 
that the immediate post-COVID recovery opens up opportunities to scale up financing from billions to 
trillions  (15.6.7)  (Mawdsley  2018).  As  discussed  in  section  4.2.5,  accelerated  mitigation  pathways 
encompass  both rapid  deployment  of  new  technologies  such  as  CCS  or  electric  vehicles,  as  well  as 
changes in consumption patterns: rapid deployment of mitigation technology and behaviour change are 
thus two enabling conditions to accelerated mitigation. Dynamics of deployment of technologies are 
relatively well known, pointing to specific, short-term action to accelerate innovation and deployment 
(Cross-Chapter  Box  12),  whereas  dynamics  of  collective  behaviour  change  is  less  well  understood. 
Arguably, the latter also facilitates shifting development pathways.

Figure 4.8 Enabling conditions for accelerating mitigation and shifting development pathways towards 

sustainability 

Individual enabling conditions are discussed at length in Chapter 5 (behaviour change), 13 (policies, 
governance and institutional capacity), 15 (Finance) and 16 (Innovation). The purpose of the discussion 
below is to draw operational implications from these chapters for action, taking into account the focus 
of the present Chapter on action at the national level in the near- and mid-term, and its special emphasis 
on shifting development pathways in addition to accelerated mitigation.  

The rest of the section is organised as follows. Policy packages that combine climate and development 
policies  are first  discussed  (4.4.1.2).  The  next  sections  are  dedicated  to the  conditions that facilitate 
shifts  in  development  pathways  and  accelerated  mitigation:  governance  and  institutions  (4.4.1.3), 
financial  resources  (4.4.1.4),  behaviour  change  (4.4.1.5)  and  innovation  (4.4.1.6).  Four  examples  of 
how climate and development policies can be combined to shift pathways and accelerate mitigation are 
then presented (4.4.1.7, 4.4.1.8, 4.4.1.9 and 4.4.1.10). Section 4.4.2 focuses specifically on how shifts 
in development pathways can deliver both mitigation and adaptation. Finally, 4.4.3 discusses risks and 
uncertainties associated with combining shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation. 

4.4.1.2  Policy packages that include climate and development policies 
Although  many  transformations  in  the  past  have  been  driven  by  the  emergence  and  diffusion  of  an 
innovative technology, policy intervention was frequent, especially in the more rapid ones (Grubb et al. 
2021;  Michaelowa  et  al.  2018).  Likewise,  it  is  not  expected  that  spontaneous  behaviour  change  or 
market evolution alone yield the type of transformations outlined in the accelerated mitigation pathways 
described in 4.2.5, or in the shifts in development pathways described in 4.3.3. On the contrary, stringent 
temperature targets imply bold policies in the short term (Rockström et al. 2017; Kriegler et al. 2018) 
to enforce effective existing policy instruments and regulations, as well as to reform or remove harmful 
existing policies and subsidies (Díaz et al. 2019). 

Policy integration, addressing multiple objectives, is an essential component of shifting development 
pathways  and  accelerating  mitigation  (robust  evidence,  high  agreement).  A  shift  in  development 
pathways  that  fosters  accelerated  mitigation  may  best  be  achieved  through  integrated  actions  that 
comprise policies in support of the broader SDG agenda, based on country-specific priorities (4.3.2, 
13.8, 13.9). These may include for example, fiscal policies, or integrating industrial (Nilsson et al. 2021) 
and energy policies (Fragkos et al. 2021) with climate policies. Similarly, sectoral transitions that aspire 
to shifting development pathways towards sustainability often have multiple objectives, and deploy a 
diverse mix or package of policies and institutional measures (Cross-Chapter Box 5). 

Because  low-carbon  transitions  are  political  processes,  analyses  are  needed  of  policy  as  well  as  for 
policy  (13.6).  Political  scientists  have  developed  a  number  of  theoretical  models  that  both  explain 
policy-making processes and provide useful insights for influencing those processes. Case studies of 
successes and failures in sustainable development and mitigation offer equally important insights. Both 
theoretical  and  empirical  analysis  reinforce  the  argument  that  single  policy  instruments  are  not 
sufficient (robust evidence, high agreement). Policymakers might rather mobilise a range of policies, 
such as financial instruments (taxes, subsidies, grants, loans), regulatory instruments (standards, laws, 
performance targets) and processual instruments (demonstration projects, network management, public 
debates, consultations, foresight exercises, roadmaps) (Voß et al. 2007). Policies can be designed to 
focus on limiting or phasing out high-carbon technology. The appropriate mix is likely to vary between 
countries  and  domains,  depending  on  political  cultures  and  stakeholder  configurations  (Rogge  and 
Reichardt  2016),  but  is  likely  to  include  a  combination  of:  a)  standards,  nudges  and  information  to 
encourage low-carbon technology adoption and behavioural change; b) economic incentives to reward 
low  carbon  investments;  c)  supply-side  policy  instruments  including  for  fossil  fuel  production  (to

complement  demand-side  climate  policies)  and  d)  innovation  support  and  strategic  investment  to 
encourage systemic change (Grubb 2014). These approaches can be mutually reinforcing. For example, 
carbon  pricing  can  incentivise  low  carbon  innovation,  while  targeted  support  for  emerging  niche 
technologies  can  make  them  more  competitive  encourage  their  diffusion  and  ultimately  facilitate  a 
higher level of carbon pricing. Similarly, the success of feed-in tariffs in Germany only worked as well 
as it did because it formed part of a broader policy mix including “supply-push” mechanisms such as 
subsidies for research and “systemic measures” such as collaborative research projects and systems of 
knowledge exchange (Rogge et al. 2015). 

4.4.1.3  Governance and institutional capacity 
Governance for climate mitigation and shifting development pathways is enhanced when tailored to 
national and local contexts. Improved institutions and governance enable ambitious climate action and 
help bridge implementation gaps (medium evidence, high agreement). Improving institutions involve a 
broad range of stakeholders and multiple regional and temporal scales.  It necessitates a credible and 
trusted process for reconciling perspectives and balancing potential side-effects, managing winners and 
losers  and  adopting  compensatory  measures  to  ensure  an  inclusive  and  just  transition  (Newell  and 
Mulvaney  2013;  Miller  and  Richter  2014;  Diffenbaugh  and  Burke  2019;  Gambhir  et  al.  2018), 
managing the risk of inequitable or non-representative power dynamics and avoiding regulatory capture 
by special interests (Helsinki Design Lab 2014; Kahane 2019; Boulle et al. 2015). 

Long experience of political management of change demonstrates that managing such risks is not easy, 
and  requires sufficiently  strong  and  competent  institutions  (Stiglitz 1998).  For example,   shift away 
from fossil fuel-based energy economy could significantly disrupt the status quo, leading to a stranding 
of financial and capital assets and shifting of political-economic power. Ensuring the decision-making 
process  is  not  unduly  influenced  by  actors  with  much  to  lose  is  key  to  managing  a  transformation. 
Effective governance, as noted in Chapter 13, requires establishing strategic direction, coordination of 
policy  responses, and mediation  among  divergent  interests.  Among  varieties of  climate  governance, 
which institutions emerge is path-dependent, based on the interplay of national political institutions, 
international drivers, and bureaucratic structures (Dubash 2021). Focused national climate institutions 
to address these challenges are more likely to emerge, persist and be effective when they are consistent 
with a framing of climate change that has broad national political support (medium evidence, medium 
agreement) (4.5, 13.2, 13.5).  

Innovative governance approaches can help meet these challenges (Clark et al. 2018; Díaz et al. 2019). 
Enabling multilevel governance—i.e., better alignment across governance scales—and coordination of 
international  organisations  and  national  governments  can  help  accelerate  a  transition  to  sustainable 
development and deep decarbonisation  (Tait and Euston-Brown 2017; Michaelowa and Michaelowa 
2017;  Ringel  2017;  Revi  2017;  Cheshmehzangi  2016;  IPCC  2018a).  Participatory  and  inclusive 
governance—partnerships between state and non-state actors—, and concerted effort across different 
stakeholders are crucial in supporting acceleration (Roberts 2016; Hering et al. 2014; Figueres et al. 
2017; Leal Filho et al. 2018; Burch et al. 2014; Lee et al. 2018; Clark et al. 2018). So do partnerships 
through  transnational  climate  governance  initiatives,  which  coordinate  nation-states  and  non-state 
actors on an international scale (Hsu et al. 2018). Although they are unlikely to close the gap of the 
insufficient mitigation effort of national governments (Michaelowa and Michaelowa 2017) (4.2.3), they 
help  building  confidence  in  governments  concerning  climate  policy  and  push  for  more  ambitious 
national goals (UNEP 2018b). 

Meeting  these  challenges  also  requires  enhanced  institutional  capacity  and  enhanced  institutional 
mechanisms to strengthen the coordination between multiple actors, improve complementarities and 
synergies between multiple objectives (Rasul 2016; Ringel 2017; Liu et al. 2018) and pursue climate

action and other development objectives in an integrated and coherent way (Rogelj et al. 2018b; Von 
Stechow et al. 2016; Fuso Nerini et al. 2019; Roy et al. 2018; McCollum et al. 2018), particularly in 
developing countries (Adenle et al. 2017; Rosenbloom 2017). Institutional capacities to be strengthened 
include vertical collaboration and interaction within Nation-States and horizontal collaboration (e.g., 
transnational city networks) for the development and implementation of plans, regulations and policies. 
More specifically capacities include: capacity for knowledge harnessing and integration (from multiple 
perspectives);  for  integrated  policy  design  and  implementation  (Scott  2017);  for  long-term  planning 
(Lecocq et al. 2021) for monitoring and review process; for coordinating multi-actor processes to create 
synergies and avoid trade-offs. As a result, institutions that enable and improve human capacities and 
capabilities are a major driver of transformation. To this extent, promoting education, health care and 
social safety, also are instrumental to undertake climate change mitigation and cope with environmental 
problems (Winkler et al. 2007; Sachs et al. 2019). Given that strengthening institutions may be a long 
term endeavour, it needs attention in the near-term. 

4.4.1.4  Channelling financial resources 
Accelerated  mitigation  and  shifting  development  pathways  necessitate  both  re-directing  existing 
financial  flows  from  high-  to  low-emissions  technologies  and  systems  and  providing  additional 
resources (robust evidence, high agreement). An example is changes in investments from fossil fuels to 
renewable energy, with pressures to disinvest in the former while increasing levels of ‘green finance’ 
(6.7.4,  15.5).  While  some  lower-carbon  technologies  have  become  competitive  (1.4.3,  2.5),  support 
remains needed for the low-emissions options have higher costs per unit of service provided than high-
emission  ones.  Lack  of  financial  resources  is  identified  as  a  major  barrier  to  the  implementation  of 
accelerated mitigation and of shifts in development pathways. Overcoming this obstacle has two major 
components. One relates to private capital. The other to public finance. 

There is substantial amount of research on the redirection of private financial flows towards low-carbon 
investment and the role of financial regulators and central banks, as detailed in Chapter 15. Financial 
systems are an indispensable element of a systemic transition (Fankhauser et al. 2016; Naidoo 2020). 
Policy frameworks can re-direct financial resources towards low-emission assets and services (UNEP 
2015), mainstreaming  climate  finance  within  financial  and  banking  system regulation,  and  reducing 
transaction costs for bankable mitigation technology projects (Mundaca et al. 2013; Brunner and Enting 
2014; Yeo 2019). Shifts in the financial system to finance climate mitigation and other SDGs can be 
achieved by aligning incentives and investments with multiple objectives (UNEP Inquiry 2016). 

Different  approaches  have  been  explored  to  improve  such  alignment  (15.6),  from  national  credit 
policies  to  directly  green  mainstream  financial  regulations  (e.g.,  through  modifications  in  the  Basel 
rules for banks). For all approaches, an essential precondition is to assess and monitor the contribution 
of financial flows to climate and sustainability goals, with better metrics that clearly link with financial 
activity  (Chenet  et al.  2019).  Enabling  the  alignment  of  investment  decision-making  with  achieving 
climate  and  broader  sustainability  goals  includes  acknowledgment  and  disclosure  of  climate-change 
related risk and of risks associated with mitigation in financial portfolios. Current disclosures remain 
far from the scale the markets need to channel investment to sustainable and resilient solutions (UNEP 
- Finance Initiative 2020; Clark et al. 2018; Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 2019; 
IPCC 2018b). Disclosure, however, is not enough (Ameli et al. 2020). In addition, climate targets can 
be translated into investment roadmaps and financing needs for financial institutions, both at national 
and  international  level.  Financing  needs  are  usable  for  financial  institutions,  to  inform  portfolio 
allocation decisions and financing priorities (Chenet et al. 2019). At the international level, for example, 
technology roadmaps for key sectors can be translated into investment roadmaps and financing needs, 
as shown by existing experiences in energy and industrial sectors (Chenet et al. 2019; WBSCD 2018; 
International Energy Agency 2015)

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Final Government Distribution  
 
 
 
The  transition  from  traditional  public  climate  finance  interventions  to  the  market-based  support  of 
climate  mitigation  (Bodnar  et  al.  2018)  demands  innovative  forms  of  financial  cooperation  and 
innovative financing mechanisms to help de-risk low-emission investments and support new business 
models.  These  financial  innovations  may  involve  sub-national  actors  like  cities  and  regional 
governments  in  raising  finance  to  achieve  their  commitments  (Cartwright  2015;  CCFLA  2017). 
Moreover, public-private partnerships have proved to be an important vehicle for financing investments 
to meet the SDGs, including economic instruments for financing conservation (Sovacool 2013; Díaz et 
al. 2019). 

Overall, early action is needed to overcome barriers and to adjust the existing i..ncentive system to align 
national development strategies with climate and sustainable development goals in the medium-term. 
Steckel  et  al.  (2017)  conclude  that  climate  finance  could  become  a  central  pillar  of  sustainable 
development by reconciling the global goal of cost-efficient mitigation with national policy priorities. 
Without a more rapid, scaled redeployment of financing, in development trajectories that hinder the 
realisation of the global goals will be locked in (Zadek and Robins 2016). Investment might be designed 
to avoid trading off  the Paris goals against other SDGs, as well as those that simultaneously reduce 
poverty, inequality, and emissions (Fuso Nerini et al. 2019). 

At the national level, it is also essential to create  public fiscal space for actions promoting the SDG 
agenda and thereby broadening the scope of mitigation (medium evidence, medium agreement). To do 
so,  pricing  carbon—either  through  tax  payments  based  on  the  level  of  emissions  or  cap-and-trade 
systems that limit total allowable emissions—is an efficient means of discouraging carbon emissions 
throughout  an  economy  (both  in  consumption  and  production)  while  simultaneously  encouraging  a 
switch to non-carbon energy sources and generating revenues for prioritised actions (13.6.3). Regarding 
to levels, the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices concluded that “carbon-price level consistent 
with achieving the Paris temperature target is at least USD40–80/tCO2 by 2020 and USD50–100/tCO2 
by 2030, provided a supportive policy environment is in place” (CPLC 2017; Wall Street Journal 2019). 
National level models yield median carbon values of carbon values of 733 USD/tCO2 in 2050 along 
accelerated mitigation pathways (4.2.6), while global models find a median value of 578 USD/tCO2 for 
pathways that reach net zero CO2 between 2045 and 2055 [interquartile range 405-708] (3.6.1).  

Carbon pricing, however, is designed to reduce its fiscal base. Fiscal space may therefore also need to 
stem from  other  sources,  although fiscal  reforms  are complex  endeavours (4.4.1.8).  For  countries  at 
lower income levels, foreign aid can make an important contribution to the same agenda (Kharas and 
McArthur 2019).It may also be noted that, according to estimates at the global level, military spending 
amounted  to  USD1.748  trillion  in  2012  (the  last  year  with  data),  a  figure  that  corresponded  to  2.3 
percent of GDP, 55 percent of government spending in education, and was 13 times the level of net 
ODA (World Bank 2020; SIPRI 2020). Given this, moderate reductions in military spending (which 
may  involve  conflict  resolution  and  cross-country  agreements  on  arms  limitations)  could  free  up 
considerable resources for the SDG agenda, both in the countries that reduce spending and in the form 
of ODA. The resolution of conflicts within and between countries before they become violent would 
also reduce the need for public and private spending repairing human and physical damage. The fact 
that  civil  wars  are  common  in  the  countries  that  face  the  severest  SDG  challenges  underscores  the 
importance of this issue (Collier 2007 pp.17-37).  

4.4.1.5  Changing behaviour and lifestyles 
Changes  in  behaviour  and  lifestyles  are  important  to  accelerated  mitigation.  Most  global  mitigation 
pathways in line with likely below 2°C and 1.5°C temperature limits assume substantial behavioural 
and societal change and low-c  arbon lifestyles (Luderer et al. 2018a; de Coninck et al. 2018; IPCC 
2018a)  (See  also  3.3,  and  Table  4.9  and  Figure  4.3  in  IPCC  SR  1.5).  Chapter  5  concludes  that

behavioural changes within transition pathways offer Gigaton-scale CO2 savings potential at the global 
level, an often overlooked strategy in traditional mitigation scenarios. 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Individual motivation and capacity are impacted by different factors that go beyond traditional social, 
demographic and economic predictors. However, it is unclear to what extent behavioural factors (i.e., 
cognitive, motivational and contextual aspects) are taken into account in policy design (Mundaca et al. 
2019; Dubois et al. 2019). In fact, while economic policies play a significant role in influencing people’s 
decisions and behaviour, many drivers of human behaviour and values work largely outside the market 
system  (Díaz  et  al.  2019;  Winkler  et  al.  2015)  as  actors  in  society,  particularly  individuals,  do  not 
respond  in  an  economically  ‘rational’  manner  based  on  perfect-information  cost-benefit  analyses 
(Shiller 2019; Runge 1984). Rather, compelling narratives can drive individuals to adopt new norms 
and  policies.  And  norms  can  be  more  quickly  and  more  robustly  shifted  by  proposing  and  framing 
policies designed with awareness of how framings interact with individual cognitive tendencies (van 
der Linden et al. 2015). Transformative policies are thus much more likely to be successfully adopted 
and  lead  to  long-term  behavioural  change  if  designed  in  accordance  with  principles  of  cognitive 
psychology (van der Linden et al. 2015), and with the deep understanding of decision-making offered 
by behavioural science (UNEP 2017b). Similarly, given that present bias—being motivated by costs 
and benefits that take effect immediately than those delivered later—significantly shapes behaviour, 
schemes that bring forward distant costs into the present or that upfront incentives have proved to be 
more  effective  (Zauberman  et  al.  2009;  van  den  Broek  et  al.  2017;  Safarzyńska  2018).  Overall, 
transformational  strategies  that  align  mitigation  with  subjective  life  satisfaction,  and  build  societal 
support by positive discourses about economic, social, and cultural benefits of low-carbon innovations, 
promises far more success than targeting mitigation alone (Asensio and Delmas 2016; WBGU 2011; 
Geels et al. 2017). 

Climate actions are related to knowledge but even strongly to motivational factors (Hornsey et al. 2016; 
Bolderdijk et al. 2013; Boomsma and Steg 2014), which explains the gap between awareness and action 
(Ünal  et  al.  2018).  Social  influences,  particularly  from  peers,  affect  people’s  engagement in  climate 
action  (Schelly  2014).  Role  models  appear  to  have  a  solid  basis  in  people’s  everyday  preferences 
(WBGU  2011).  Social  norms  can  reinforce  individuals’  underlying  motivations  and  be  effective  in 
encouraging  sustainable  consumption  patterns,  as  many  examples  offered  by  behavioural  science 
illustrate. Social networks also influence and spread behaviours (Service et al. 2014; Clayton et al. 2015; 
Farrow et al. 2017; Shah et al. 2019). These social influences can be harnessed by climate policy. 

Collective action by individuals as part of formal social movements or informal lifestyle movements 
underpins system change (robust evidence, high agreement) (5.4, 5.5). Organisations are comprised of 
individuals,  but  also  become  actors  in  their  own  right.  Recent  literature  has  considered  the  role  of 
coalitions  and  social  movements  in  energy  democracy  and  energy  transitions  towards  sustainability 
(Hess 2018). Other scholars have examined the role of women in redistributing power, both in the sense 
of  energy  transition  and  in  terms  of  gender  relations  (Allen  et  al.  2019;  Routledge  et  al.  2018). 
Mitigation  and  broader  sustainable  development  policies  that  facilitate  active  participation  by 
stakeholders  can  build  trust,  forge  new  social  contracts,  and  contribute  to  a  positive  cycle  building 
climate governance capacity (5.2.3). 

However, behavioural change not embedded in structural change will contribute little to climate change 
mitigation,  suggesting  that  behavioural  change  is  not  only  a  function  of  individual  agency  but  also 
depends  on  other  enabling  factors,  such  as  the  provision  of  infrastructure  and  institutions  (5.4). 
Successful  shifts  towards  public  transport,  for  example,  involve  technologies  (buses,  trams), 
infrastructure (light rail, dedicated bus lanes), regulations (operational licenses, performance contracts),

depends on such choices as housing or planning policies (4.4.1.9).

4.4.1.6  Fostering Technological Innovation 
As  outlined  in  section  4.2.5,  rapid,  large-scale  deployment  of  improved  low-carbon  technology  is  a 
critical component of accelerated mitigation pathways. As part of its key role in technological change, 
R&D can make a crucial contribution to accelerated mitigation up to 2030 and beyond, among other 
things  by  focusing  on  closing  technology  gaps  that  stand  in  the  way  of  decarbonising  today’s  high 
emitting  sectors.  Such  sectors  include  shipping,  trucking,  aviation  and  heavy  industries  like  steel, 
cement and chemicals. More broadly, it is increasingly clear that digital changes are becoming a key 
driving force in societal transformation (Tegmark 2017). Digitalisation is not only an “instrument” for 
resolving  sustainability  challenges,  it  is  also  a  fundamental  driver  of  disruptive,  multiscalar  change 
(Sachs et al. 2019) that amounts to a shift in development pathway. Information and communication 
technologies, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, nanotechnologies, biotechnologies, robotics, 
are  not  usually  categorised  as  climate  technologies,  but  have  a  potential  impact  on  GHG  emissions 
(OECD 2017b) (Cross-Chapter Box 11).  

The direction of innovation matters (robust evidence, high agreement). The research community has 
called for more “responsible innovation” (Pandza and Ellwood 2013), “open innovation” (Rauter et al. 
2019), “mission-oriented” innovation (Mazzucato and Semieniuk 2017), “holistic innovation” (Chen et 
al.  2018b),  “next-generation  innovation  policy”  (Kuhlmann  and  Rip  2018)  or  “transformative 
innovation” (Schot and Steinmueller 2018) so that innovation patterns and processes are commensurate 
to our growing sustainability challenges. There is a growing recognition that new forms of innovation 
can be harnessed and coupled to climate objectives (Fagerberg et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018). As such, 
innovation  and  sociotechnical  change  can  be  channelled  to  intensify  mitigation  via  “deliberate 
acceleration” (Roberts et al. 2018a) and “coalition building” (Hess 2018).  

Innovation goes beyond technology. For example,  decarbonisation in sectors with long lived capital 
stock  (such  as  heavy  industry,  buildings,  transport  infrastructure)  entail  technology,  policy  and 
financing innovations (Bataille 2020). Similarly, expanding the deployment of photovoltaics can draw 
upon policies that support specific technical innovations (e.g., to improve photovoltaics efficiency), or 
innovations in regulatory and market regimes (e.g., net-metering), to innovations in social organisation 
(e.g., community-ownership). System innovation is a core focus of the transitions literature (Grin et al. 
2010; Markard et al. 2012; Geels et al. 2017). Accelerating low carbon transitions not only involves a 
shift  of  system  elements  but  also  underlying  routines  and  rules,  and  hence  transitions  shift  the 
directionality of innovation. They hence concern the development of a new paradigm or regime that is 
more focused on solving sustainability challenges that cannot be solved within the dominant regime 
they substitute (Cross-Chapter Box 12).  

Several  studies  have  pointed  at the  important  possible  contributions of grassroots innovators  for the 
start-up of sustainability transitions (Seyfang and Smith 2007; Smith et al. 2016; Seyfang et al. 2014). 
In particular, a range of studies have shown that users can play a variety of roles in promoting system 
innovation:  shielding,  nurturing  (including  learning, networking  and  visioning) and  empowering  the 
niches in relation to the dominant system and regime  (Schot et al. 2016; Randelli and Rocchi 2017; 
Meelen et al. 2019). More fundamentally, innovation regimes can be led and guided by markets driven 
by monetizable profits (as much of private sector led technological innovation of patentable intellectual 
property), or prioritise social returns (e.g., innovation structures such as innovation prizes, public sector 
innovation, investments in human capital, and socially-beneficial intellectual property regimes). In both 
cases, public policies can play a key role by providing resources and favourable incentives (IEA 2020). 
Chapter 16 provides more details on ways to foster innovation.

4.4.1.7  Example: Structural change provides a way to keep jobs and mitigate 
Developing  countries  have  experienced  a  period of rapid economic  growth  in  the  past two  decades. 
Patterns of growth have differed markedly across regions, with newly emerging East Asian economies 
building  on  transition  to  manufacturing—as  China  has  done  in  the  past—while  Latin  American 
countries tend to transition directly from primary sector to services (Rodrik 2016), and African countries 
tend to rely on productivity improvements in the primary sectors (Diao et al. 2019). Yet many countries 
still face the challenge of getting out of the “middle-income trap” (Agénor and Canuto 2015), as labour-
saving technological change and globalisation have limited options to develop via the manufacturing 
sector (Altenburg and Rodrik 2017). 

Looking ahead, several studies have illustrated how structural change towards sustainability could lead 
to reduced emissions intensity and higher mitigative capacity. In China, for example, the shift away 
from heavy industry (to light industry and services) has already been identified as the most important 
force limiting emissions growth (Guan et al. 2018), and as a major factor for future emissions (Kwok 
et al. 2018). 

Overall,  Altenburg  et  al.  (2017)  argue  that  reallocation  of  capital  and  labour  from  low-  to  high-
productivity sectors—i.e., structural change—remains a necessity, and that it is possible to combine it 
with reduced environmental footprint (including, but not limited to, mitigation). They argue that this 
dual challenge calls for structural transformation policies different from those implemented in the past, 
most importantly through a “systematic steering of investment behaviour in a socially agreed direction” 
and encompassing policy coordination (limited evidence, medium agreement). 

In order to permit progress on their SDG agendas, it is essential that countries develop visions of their 
future decarbonised sectoral production structure, including its ability to generate growth in incomes, 
employment and foreign exchange earnings. as well as the related spatial distribution of production, 
employment,  and  housing.  To  this  extent,  governance  and  institutional  capacity  matter,  such  as 
availability of tools to support long-term planning. A sectoral structure that permits strong growth is 
essential given strong associations between growth in per-capita incomes and progress on most SDGs 
(including those related to poverty; health; education; and access to water, sanitation, electricity, and 
roads; but not income equality), in part due to the fact that higher incomes provide both households and 
governments with resources that at least in part would be used to promote SDGs (Gable et al. 2015). 

The  future  viability  of  sectors  will  depend  on  the  extent  to  which  they  can  remain  profitable  while 
relying on lower-carbon energy. The challenge to identify alternative sectors of growth is particularly 
acute  for  countries  that today  depend  on  oil and  natural  gas for most  of  their  foreign  exchange  and 
government  revenues  (Mirzoev  et  al.  2020).  Changes  in  economic  structure  will  also  have  gender 
implications since the roles of men and women vary across sectors. For example, in many developing 
countries, sectors in which women play a relatively important role, including agriculture and unpaid 
household services like collection of water and fuel wood, may be negatively affected by climate change 
(Roy 2018). It may thus be important to take complementary actions to address the gender implications 
of changes in economic structure.  

Given  strong  complementarities  between  policies  discussed  above,  an  integrated  policy  approach  is 
crucial. For example, as suggested, the actions that influence the pace at which GHG emissions can be 
cut  with  political  support  may  depend  on  taxation  (including  carbon  taxes),  investments  in 
infrastructure,  spending  on  R&D,  changes  in  income  distribution  (influenced  by  transfers),  and 
communication. In this light, it is important to consider the demands that alternative policy packages 
put  on  government  policy-making  efficiency  and  credibility  as  well  as  the  roles  of  other  enabling 
conditions.  In  fact,  plans  to  undertake  major  reforms  may  provide  governments  with  impetus  to

4.4.1.8  Example: Embedding carbon finance in broader fiscal reforms offers a way to mitigate and 

rethink the social contract 

In many countries, fiscal systems are currently under stress to provide resources for the implementation 
of development priorities, such as, for example, providing universal health coverage and other social 
services (Meheus and McIntyre 2017) or sustainably funding pension systems in the context of aging 
populations (Asher and Bali 2017; Cruz-Martinez 2018). Overall, Baum et al. (2017) argue that low-
income countries are likely not to have the fiscal space to undertake the investment entailed in reaching 
the SDGs. To create additional fiscal space, major options include improving tax recovery, reducing 
subsidies and levying additional taxes. 

Mitigation  offers  an  opportunity  to  create  additional  fiscal  space,  and  thus  to  serve  the  objectives 
outlined above, by creating a new source of revenue for the government via carbon taxation or emissions 
permit auctioning and by reducing existing expenditures via reduction in subsidies to fossil-fuel. The 
1991 tax reform in Sweden is an early example in which environmental taxation (including, but not 
limited to, fossil fuel taxation) was introduced as part of a package primarily aimed at lowering the 
marginal  tax  rates  (more  than  80%  at  the  time),  at  reducing  other  taxes,  while  keeping  most  of  the 
welfare  state.  To  do  so,  the  tax  base  was  broadened,  including  through  environmental  and  carbon 
taxation (Sterner 2007). Once in place, the carbon tax rate was substantially ramped up over time, and 
its base broadened (Criqui et al. 2019). 

The  future  potential  for  using  carbon  taxation  as  a  way  to  provide  space  for  fiscal  reform  has  been 
highlighted in the so-called “green fiscal reform” literature (Vogt-Schilb et al. 2019). The potential is 
large, since only 13 percent of global GHG emissions were covered by carbon pricing schemes in 2019 
(Watts et al. 2019) and since many countries price carbon negatively by subsidising fossil fuel use, thus 
generating effects that are the opposite of those that positive carbon prices hope to promote. In 2018, 
the  global  subsidy  value  amounted  to  $427  billion,  i.e.,  some  10  times  the  payment  for  carbon  use 
(Watts et al. 2019). However, the size of the potential for creating fiscal space varies strongly across 
countries given differences in terms of current carbon prices and fuel subsidies. 

The limited adoption of and political support for carbon pricing may be explained by the fact that most 
of the gains occur in the future and depend on actions across the globe, making them seem abstract and 
unpredictable,  whereas  the  costs  in  the form  of higher  carbon  prices are immediate  (Karapin  2016). 
Furthermore, the links between carbon pricing and emissions may not be clear to the public who, in 
addition, may not trust that the government will use budgetary savings according to stated plans. The 
latter  may  be  due  to  various  factors,  including  a  history  of  limited  government  commitment  and 
corruption (Maestre-Andrés et al 2019 ; Withana & Sirini 2016; Chadwick 2017). 

The  literature  reports  limited  systematic  evidence  based  on  ex  post  analysis  of  the  performance  of 
carbon  pricing–carbon  taxes  and  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  trading  systems  (ETSs)  (Haites 
2018). Performance assessment is complicated by the effect of other policies and exogenous factors. 
(Haites  2018)  suggests  that  since  2008,  other  policies  have  probably  contributed  more  to  emission 
reductions than carbon taxes, and most tax rates are too low to achieve mitigation objectives. Emissions 
under  ETSs  have  declined,  with the exception  of  four  systems  without  emissions  caps  (ibid).  Every 
jurisdiction with an ETS and/or carbon tax also has other policies that affect its GHG emissions. 

To  help  policymakers  overcome  obstacles,  research  has  reviewed  the  international  experience  from 
carbon pricing reforms. Elimination of fossil fuel subsidies, equivalent to the elimination of negative 
carbon  prices,  have  been  more  successful  when  they  have  included  complementary  and  transparent

measures  that  enjoy  popular  support,  accompanied  by  a  strong  communications  component  that 
explains the measures and stresses their benefits (Rentschler and Bazilian 2017; Withana & Sirini 2016; 
Maestre-Andrés et al 2019). 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Part of the losses (and related calls for compensation or exemptions) due to carbon pricing are related 
to the fact that it hurts the competitiveness of sectors that face imports from countries with lower carbon 
prices,  leading  to  “carbon  leakage”  if  carbon-intensive  production  (and  related  jobs)  migrates  from 
countries with relatively high carbon prices. Research confirms that a border carbon tax (or adjustment), 
set on the basis of the carbon content of the import, including a downward adjustment on the basis of 
any carbon payments (taxes or other) already made before entry, could reduce carbon leakage while 
also raising additional revenue and encouraging carbon pricing in the exporting country  (Withana & 
Sirini 2016; Cosbey et al  2019). 

The timing of carbon pricing reforms is also important: they are more likely to succeed if they exploit 
windows of opportunity provided by events that raise awareness of the costs of carbon emissions (like 
bouts of elevated local air pollution or reports about the role of emissions in causing global warming), 
as  well  as  momentum  from  climate  actions  by  other  countries  and  international  climate  agreements 
(Karapin 2016; Jakob et al 2019). It is also important to consider the level of international prices of 
carbon  energy:  when  they  are  low,  consumer  resistance  would  be  smaller  since  prices  will  remain 
relatively low, though the tax may become more visible when energy prices increase again. As part of 
ongoing efforts to accelerate mitigation, such tax hikes may be crucial to avoid a slow-down in the shift 
to renewable energy sources (Rentschler and Bazilian 2017; Withana & Sirini 2016). In countries that 
exports carbon energy, carbon taxation may run into additional resistance from producers. 

There is also considerable literature providing insights on the political and social acceptability of carbon 
taxes, suggesting for example that political support may be boosted if the revenue is recycled to the tax 
payers  or  earmarked  for  areas  with  positive  environmental  effects  (e.g.,  (Bachus  et  al.  2019)  for 
Belgium,  and  (Beiser-McGrath  and  Bernauer  2019)  for  Germany  and  the  USA),  as  well  as  on  the 
difficulties associated with political vagaries (and economic consequences thereof) associated with the 
introduction of such instruments (Pereira et al. 2016). Similarly, “best practice” have been drawn from 
past experience on fossil-fuel subsidy reforms (Sovacool 2017; Rentschler and Bazilian 2017). Specific 
policies, however, depend on societal objectives, endowments, structure of production, employment, 
and trade, and institutional structure (including the functioning of markets and government capacity) 
(Kettner et al. 2019). As noted in Section 4.2.6, macroeconomic analysis finds that the overall economic 
implications of carbon pricing differ markedly depending on the way the proceeds from carbon pricing 
are used, and thus on the way the fiscal system is reformed, with potential for double dividend if the 
proceeds from the tax are used to repeal the most distortive taxes in the economy. 

In the context of this section on development pathways, it is worth emphasising that potential revenues 
drawn from the climate mitigation component of the fiscal reform varies strongly with the context, and 
may  not  be  sufficient  to  address  the  other  objectives  pursued.  Even  if  the  carbon  price  is  high,  the 
revenue it generates may be moderate as a share of GDP and eventually it will be zero if emissions are 
eliminated. For example, Jakob et al. (2016) find that the carbon pricing revenues that most countries 
in  Sub-Saharan  Africa  could expect to  generate  only would meet  a small part of  their infrastructure 
spending needs. In Sweden, the country with the highest carbon tax rate in the world, the tax has not 
been a significant part of total tax revenues. Moreover, emissions from sectors covered by the tax have 
shrunk and, as a result, the revenues from the tax, as a share of GDP, have also declined, from a peak 
of 0.93 percent in 2004, when the rate was USD109 per metric ton of CO2, to 0.48 per cent in 2018, 
when  the  rate  had  reached  USD132  (Jonsson  et  al.  2020;  Statistics  Sweden  2020).  This  means  that 
governments that want to avoid a decline in the GDP share for total tax revenues over time would have

to raise the intake from other taxes. However, it is here important to note that domestic tax hikes are 
likely  to  involve  trade-offs  since,  at  the  same  time  as  the  spending  they  fund  may  provide  various 
benefits, they may also reduce the capacity of households and the private sector to consume and invest, 
something that may reduce growth over time and reduced resources for spending in support of human 
development (Lofgren et al. 2013). It is also worth emphasising that restructuring of the fiscal system 
amount to changes in the social contract of the society (Combet and Hourcade 2017, 2014), and thus 
represents a major economic and social decision. 

4.4.1.9  Example: Combining housing policies with carbon taxation can deliver both housing and 

mitigation in the transport sector 

The spatial distribution of households and firms across urban and rural areas is a central characteristic 
of  development  pathways.  Patterns  of  urbanisation,  territorial  development, and regional  integration 
have wide-ranging implications for economic, social and environmental objectives (World Bank 2009). 
Notably, choices regarding spatial forms of development have large-scale implications for demand for 
transportation and associated GHG emissions. 

Exclusionary  mechanisms  such  as  decreasing  accessibility  and  affordability  of  inner-urban 
neighbourhoods  is  a  major  cause  of  suburbanisation  of  low-  to  middle-income  households  (e.g., 
(Hochstenbach and Musterd 2018). Suburbanisation, in turn, is associated with higher transportation 
demand (Bento et al. 2005) and higher carbon footprints for households (Jones and Kammen 2014). 
Similarly,  other  studies  find  a  significant  positive  link  between  housing  prices  and  energy  demand 
(Lampin et al. 2013). 

Reducing emissions from transport in cities through traditional climate policy instruments (e.g., through 
a carbon tax) is more difficult when inner-urban neighbourhoods are less accessible and less affordable, 
because exclusionary mechanisms act as a countervailing force to the rising transportation costs induced 
by the climate policy, pushing households outwards rather than inwards. Said differently, the costs of 
mitigating intra-city  transportation  emissions  are  higher  when  inner-urban  housing  prices  are  higher 
(Lampin et al. 2013). 

This suggests that policies making inner-urban neighbourhoods more accessible and more affordable 
can  open  up  broader  opportunities  for  suburban  households  to  relocate  in  the  face  of  increasing 
transportation costs. This is particularly important for low- and middle-income households, who spend 
a greater portion of their income on housing and transportation, and are more likely to be locked into 
locations that are distant from their jobs. Making inner-urban neighbourhoods more accessible and more 
affordable has the potential to reduce both the social costs—e.g., households feeling helpless in front 
of rising fuel prices—and the economic costs of mitigation policies—as a lower price of carbon is likely 
to achieve the same amount of emission reductions since households have more capacities to adjust. 

Making  inner-cities  neighbourhoods  more  accessible  and  more  affordable  is  a  complex  endeavour 
(Benner and Karner 2016). At the same time, it is already a policy objective in its own right in many 
countries, independent of the climate mitigation motivation, for a range of social, health and economic 
reasons.  Revenues  derived  from  climate  policies  could  provide  additional  resources  to  support  such 
programs, as some climate policy already have provisions to use their revenues towards low-income 
groups (Karner and Marcantonio 2018). The mitigation benefits of keeping inner-cities more accessible 
and affordable for low- and middle-income households often remains out of, or is only emerging in the 
debates surrounding the planning of fast-developing cities in many developing countries (Grant 2015; 
IADB  2012;  Khosla  and  Bhardwaj  2019).  Finally,  from  a  political  economy  perspective,  it  is  also 
interesting to note that (Bergquist et al. 2020) find higher support for climate policy packages in the 
U.S. when affordable housing programs are included.

In  addition,  investment  in  infrastructure  is  critical  to  the  development  of  decarbonised  economic 
structures that generate growth, employment, and universal access to a wide range of services that are 
central to the SDG agenda: transportation, water, sanitation, electricity, flood protection, and irrigation. 
For low- and middle-income countries, annual costs of reaching these goals by 2030 and putting their 
economies on a path toward decarbonisation may range between 2 and 8 percent of GDP, with the level 
depending  on  spending  efficiency.  Notably,  these  costs  need  not  exceed  those  of  more  polluting 
alternatives  (Rozenberg  and  Fay  2019).  For  transportation,  this  involves  a  shift  toward  more  public 
transportation (rail and bus), and decarbonised electricity for vehicles, combined with land-use policies 
that densify cities and reduce distances between homes and jobs. By influencing the spatial distribution 
of households and firms and the organisation of transportation, infrastructure has a strong bearing on 
GHG  emissions  and  the  costs  of  providing  services  to  different  populations.  Depending  on  country 
context,  the  private  sector  may  play  a  particularly  important  role  in  the  financing  of  infrastructure 
(World Bank 2009; Klein 2015). 

Many investments in infrastructure and sectoral capital stocks have long lifetimes. Given this, it may 
be important to make sure that today’s investments be fully decarbonised at the start or that they later 
can be converted to zero carbon. Today’s investments in electric vehicles in settings where electricity 
is produced with fossil fuels is an example of convertible investments—they will be decarbonised once 
electricity  production  has  switched  to  renewable  energies.  For  capital  stocks  that  cannot  be 
decarbonised, countries may face costs of decommissioning well before the end of their useful lifetimes, 
especially when it is needed to respect country commitments to future full decarbonisation. 

4.4.1.10  Example: Changing economic, social and spatial patterns of development of the agriculture 

sector provide the basis for sustained reductions in emissions from deforestation 

A  growing  literature  assesses  co-benefits  of  sectoral  policies  that  lead  to  decarbonisation  and 
simultaneously promote economic development, improve living standards, reduce inequality, and create 
job opportunities (Bataille et al. 2018; Pye et al. 2016; Maroun and Schaeffer 2012; Richter et al. 2018; 
Bataille  et  al.  2016b;  La  Rovere  et  al.  2018;  Waisman  et  al.  2019).  While  this  may  be  particularly 
challenging  in  developing  countries,  given  large  populations  still  lacking  basic  needs,  previous 
development paths show that finding synergies in development and climate objectives in the AFOLU 
sector is possible. One example is Brazil, which has arguably shifted its development pathway to reduce 
emissions and make progress towards several SDGs, though progress is not linear. Over the past two 
decades, Brazil had made remarkable progress in implementing a sequence of policies across multiple 
sectors.  This  policy  package  simultaneously  increased  minimum  wages  of  low  income  families, 
achieved universal energy access, and raised the quality of life and well-being for the large majority of 
the population (Da Silveira Bezerra et al. 2017; Grottera et al. 2018, 2017; La Rovere et al. 2018). This 
led to significant social benefits, reduction of income inequality and poverty eradication  (Da Silveira 
Bezerra et al. 2017; Grottera et al. 2017), reflected in a decrease of the Gini coefficient and a rise in the 
human development index (La Rovere 2017). 

Regulatory  instruments  were  used  to  limit  deforestation  rates,  together  with  implemented  economic 
instruments  that  provided  benefits  to  those  protecting  local  ecosystems  and  enhancing  land-based 
carbon sinks (Soterroni et al. 2019, 2018; Bustamante et al. 2018; Nunes et al. 2017). In parallel, public 
policies  reinforced  environmental  regulation  and  command-and-control  instruments  to  limit 
deforestation rates and implemented market-based mechanisms to provide benefits to those protecting 
local  ecosystems  and  enhancing  land-based  carbon  sinks  (Sunderlin  et  al.  2014;  Hein  et  al.  2018; 
Simonet et al. 2019; Nunes et al. 2017). The private sector, aligned with public policies and civil society, 
implemented the Amazon Soy Moratorium, a voluntary agreement that bans trading of soybeans from 
cropland associated with cleared Amazon rainforest and blacklists farmers using slave labour. This was 
achieved without undermining production of soybean commodities (Soterroni et al. 2019). As a result,

between 2005 and 2012, the country halved its GHG emissions and reduced the rate of deforestation by 
78  per  cent  (INPE  2019a,b).  This  example  shows  that  development  delivering  well-being  can  be 
accompanied  by  significant  mitigation.  A  long-term  and  strategic  vision  was  important  in  guiding 
enabling policies and mechanisms. 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

In  more recent  years,  some  of  these  shifts  in  Brazil’s  development pathways  were  undone.  Political 
changes  have  redefined  development  priorities,  with  higher  priority  being  given  to  agricultural 
development  than  climate  change  mitigation.  The  current  administration  has  reduced  the  power  of 
environmental  agencies  and  forestry  protection  laws  (including  the  forest  code),  while  allowing  the 
expansion of cropland to protected Amazon rainforest areas (Ferrante and Fearnside 2019; Rochedo et 
al. 2018). As a result, in 2020, deforestation exceeded 11,000 km2, and reached the highest rate in the 
last  12  years  (INPE  2020).  The  literature  cautions  that,  if  current  policies  and  trends  continue,  the 
Amazon may reach an irreversible tipping point beyond which it will be impossible to remediate lost 
ecosystems  and  restore  carbon  sinks  and  indigenous  people  knowledge  (Nobre  2019;  Lovejoy  and 
Nobre  2018;  INPE  2019a).  In  addition,  fossil  fuel  subsidies  and  other  fiscal  support  of  increased 
exploitation  of  oil  resources  may  create  carbon  lock-ins  that  further  inhibit  low-carbon  investments 
(Lefèvre et al. 2018). 

Brazil’s  progress  in  mitigation  depended  significantly  on  reduced  deforestation  in  the  past.  If 
deforestation rates keep on rising, mitigation efforts would need to shift to the energy sector. However, 
according to Rochedo et al. (2018), mitigation costs in the energy sector in Brazil are three times the 
costs of reducing deforestation and increasing land-based carbon sinks. Further mitigation strategies 
may depend on CCS in Brazil as elsewhere (Nogueira de Oliveira et al. 2016; Herreras Martínez et al. 
2015), though the economic feasibility of deployment is not yet clear (4.2.5.4). 

4.4.2  Adaptation, development pathways and mitigation 

Mitigation actions are strongly linked to adaptation. These connections come about because mitigation 
actions can be adaptive (e.g., some agroforestry projects) but also through policy choices (e.g., climate 
finance is allocated among adaptation or mitigation projects) and even biophysical links (e.g., climate 
trajectories, themselves determined by mitigation, can influence the viability of adaptation projects). 
As  development  pathways shape  the levers and enablers available  to  a  society (4.3.1,  Figure  4.7), a 
broader set of enabling conditions also helps with adaptation (medium evidence, high agreement). 

Previous  assessments  have  consistently  recognised  this  linkage.  The  Paris  Agreement  includes 
mitigation and adaptation as key areas of action, through NDCs and communicating adaptation actions 
and plans. The Agreement explicitly recognises that mitigation co-benefits resulting from adaptation 
can  count  towards  NDC  targets.  The  IPCC  Fifth  Assessment  Report  (IPCC  2014)  emphasised  that 
sustainable  development  is  helpful  in  going  beyond  a  narrow  focus  on  separate  mitigation  and 
adaptation options and their specific co-benefits. The IPCC Special Report on climate change and land 
addresses GHG emissions from land-based ecosystems with a focus on the vulnerability of land-based 
systems  to  climate  change.  The  report  identifies  the  potential  of  changes  to  land  use  and  land 
management practices to mitigate and adapt to climate change, and to generate co-benefits that help 
meet other SDGs (Jian et al. 2019).  

A substantial literature detailing trade-offs and synergies between mitigation and adaptation exists and 
is summarised in the IPCC SR15 including energy system transitions; land and ecosystem transitions 
(including  addressing  food  system  efficiency,  sustainable  agricultural  intensification,  ecosystem 
restoration); urban and infrastructure system transitions (including land use planning, transport systems, 
and improved infrastructure for delivering and using power); industrial system transitions (including 
energy  efficiency,  bio-based  and  circularity,  electrification  and  hydrogen,  and  industrial  Carbon

Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS); and carbon dioxide removal (including bioenergy with CCS, 
afforestation  and  reforestation,  soil  carbon  sequestration,  and  enhanced  weathering.)  (IPCC  2018: 
supplementary information Table 4.SM.5.1). Careful design of policies to shift development pathways 
towards sustainability can increase synergies and manage trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation 
(robust evidence, medium agreement). 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

This section examines how development pathways can build greater adaptive and mitigative capacity, 
and then turns to several examples of mitigation actions with implications for adaptation where there is 
a  notable  link  to  development  pathways  and  policy  choices.  These  examples  are  in  the  areas  of 
agriculture, blue carbon and terrestrial ecosystem restoration. 

4.4.2.1  Development pathways can build greater capacity for both adaptation and mitigation 
Previous IPCC assessments have reflected on making development more sustainable (Fleurbaey et al. 
2014;  Sathaye  et  al.  2007;  IPCC  et  al.  2001).  Other  assessments  have  highlighted  how  ecosystem 
functions  can  support  sustainable  development  and  are  critical  to  meeting  the  goals  of  the  Paris 
Agreement (IPBES 2019b). IPCC SR15 found that sustainable development pathways to 1.5 °C broadly 
support  and  often  enable  transformations  and  that  “sustainable  development  has  the  potential  to 
significantly reduce systemic vulnerability, enhance adaptive capacity, and promote livelihood security 
for  poor  and  disadvantaged  populations  (high  confidence)”  (IPCC  2018b:  5.3.1).  With  careful 
management,  shifting  development  pathways  can  build  greater  adaptive  and  mitigative  capacity,  as 
further  confirmed  in  recent  literature  (Schramski  et  al.  2018;  Harvey  et  al.  2014;  Ebi  et  al.  2014; 
Rosenbloom et al. 2018; Antwi-Agyei et al. 2015; Singh 2018; IPBES 2019b). The literature points to 
the  challenge  of  design  of  specific  policies  and  shifts  in  development  pathways  to  achieve  both 
mitigation and adaptation goals.  

Governance and Institutional capacity 
Governance and institutional capacity necessary for mitigation actions also enables effective adaptation 
actions. Implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions can, however, encounter different sets of 
challenges. Mitigation actions requiring a shift away from established sectors and resources (e.g., fossil 
fuels) entail governance challenges to overcome vested interests (SEI et al. 2020; Piggot et al. 2020). 
Mitigation-focused initiatives from non-state actors tend to attain greater completion than adaptation-
focused initiatives (NewClimate Institute et al. 2019). 

Behaviour and lifestyles 
On the level of individual entities, adaptation is reactive to current or anticipated environmental changes 
but  mitigation  is  undertaken  deliberately.  Chapter  5  considers  behavioural  change,  including  the 
reconsideration of values and what is meant by well-being, and reflecting on a range of actors addressing 
both adaptation and mitigation. Shifting development pathways may be disruptive (Cross Chapter Box 
5), and there may be limits to propensity to change. Some studies report that climate change deniers 
and sceptics can be induced to undertake pro-environmental action if those actions are framed in terms 
of societal welfare, not climate change (Bain et al. 2012; Hornsey et al. 2016). Concrete initiatives to 
change behaviour and lifestyles include the Transition Town movement, which seeks to implement a 
just transition—both in relation to adaptation and mitigation—in specific localities (Roy et al. 2018). 

Finance 
Finance  and  investment  of  mitigation  actions  must  be  examined  in  conjunction  with  funding  of 
adaptation actions, due to biophysical linkages and policy trade-offs (Box 15.1). Most climate funding 
supports mitigation efforts, not adaptation efforts  (Buchner et al. 2019) (Halimanjaya and Papyrakis 
2012). Mitigation projects are often more attractive to private capital (Abadie et al. 2013; Buchner et 
al. 2019). Efforts to integrate adaptation and mitigation in climate change finance are limited (Locatelli 
et al. 2016; Kongsager et al. 2016) There is a perception that integration of mitigation and adaptation

projects would lead to competition for limited finance available for adaptation (Locatelli et al. 2016). 
Long-standing debates (Ayers and Huq 2009; Smith et al. 2011) whether development finance counts 
as  adaptation  funding  remain  unresolved.  See  chapter  15  for  more  in-depth  discussion  relating 
investment in funding mitigation and adaptation actions. 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Innovation and technologies 
Systems transitions that address both adaptation and mitigation include the widespread adoption of new 
and  possibly  disruptive  technologies  and  practices  and  enhanced  climate-driven  innovation  (IPCC 
2018a). See Chapter 16 for an in-depth discussion of innovation and technology transfer. The literature 
points  to  trade-offs  that  developing  countries  face  in  investing  limited  resources  in  research  and 
development,  though  finding  synergies  in  relation  to  agriculture  (Adenle  et  al.  2015).  Other  studies 
point  to  difference  in  technology  transfers  for  adaptation  and  mitigation  (Biagini  et  al.  2014). 
Adaptation projects tend to use existing technologies whereas mitigation climate actions are more likely 
to  rely  on  novel  technologies.  Innovations  for  mitigation  are  typically  technology  transfers  from 
developed  to  less-developed  countries  (Biagini  et  al.  2014),  however  this  so-called  North-South 
technology transfer pathway is not exclusive  (Biagini et al. 2014), and is increasingly challenged by 
China’s  global  role  in  implementing  mitigation  actions  (Chen  2018;  Urban  2018).  Indigenous 
knowledge  can  be  a  unique  source  for  techniques  for  adaptation  (Nyong  et  al.  2007)  and  may  be 
favoured over externally generated knowledge (Tume et al. 2019). 

Policy 
Adaptation-focused  pathways  might  reduce  inequality,  if  adequate  support  is  available  and  well-
distributed  (Pelling  and  Garschagen  2019).  Some  studies  suggest  that  cities  might  plan  for  possible 
synergies in adaptation and mitigation strategies, currently done independently (Grafakos et al. 2019). 
The  literature  suggests  that  cities  might  identify  both  mitigation  and  adaptation  as  co-benefits  of 
interventions targeted at developmental goals (Dulal 2017). 

4.4.2.2  Specific links between mitigation and adaptation 
Mitigation actions can be adaptive and vice-versa. In particular, many nature-based solutions (NBS) for 
climate  mitigation  are  adaptive  (medium  evidence,  medium  agreement).  Multiple  NBS  are  being 
pursued under current development pathways (see Chapter 7), but shifting to sustainable development 
pathways  may  enable  a  wider  set  of  nature-based  mitigation  solutions  with  adaptation  benefits.  An 
example  of  this  would  be  a  shift  to  more  sustainable  diets  through  guidelines,  carbon  taxes,  or 
investment in R&D of animal product substitutes (Figure 13.2) which could reduce pressure on land 
and allow for implementation of multiple NBS. Many of these solutions are consistent with meeting 
other  societal  goals,  including  biodiversity  conservation  and  other  sustainable  development  goals 
(Griscom et al. 2017; Tallis et al. 2018; Fargione et al. 2018). However, there can be synergies and 
trade-offs in meeting a complex set of sustainability goals (e.g., biodiversity, see 7.6.5 and 3.1.5).  

Development is a key factor leading to land degradation in many parts of the world  (IPBES 2019b). 
Shifting development pathways to sustainability can include restoration and protection of ecosystems, 
which can enhance capacity for both mitigation and adaptation actions (IPBES 2019b). 

In  this  section,  we  explore  mitigation  actions  related  to  sustainable  agriculture,  coastal  ecosystems 
(“blue carbon”), and restoration and protection of some terrestrial ecosystems. These mitigation actions 
are  exemplary  of  trade-offs  and  synergies  with  adaptation,  sensitivity  to  biophysical  coupling,  and 
linkages to development pathways. Other specific examples can be found in Chapters 6 to 11.  

Farming system approaches can benefit mitigation and adaptation 
Farming system approaches can be a significant contributor to mitigation pathways. These practices 
(which are not mutually exclusive) include agroecology, conservation agriculture, integrated production

systems and organic farming (Box 7.5). Such methods have potential to sequester significant amounts 
of  soil  carbon (7.4.3.1)  as  well  as  reduce  emissions from  on-field  practices  such  as  rice  cultivation, 
fertilizer  management,  and  manure  management  (7.4.3)  with  total  mitigation  potential  of  3.9±0.2 
GtCO2-eq  yr-1  (Chapter  7).  Critically,  these  approaches  may  have  significant  benefits  in  terms  of 
adaptation and other development goals.  

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Farming system approaches to agricultural mitigation have a wide variety of co-benefits and tradeoffs. 
Indeed, there  are conceptual formulations  for these practices in  which  the  co-benefits  are more  of  a 
focus,  such  as  climate-smart  agriculture  (CSA)  which  ties  mitigation to  adaptation  through  its  three 
pillars of increased productivity, mitigation, and adaptation (Lipper et al. 2014). The ‘4 per 1000’ goal 
to increase soil carbon by 0.4% per year (Soussana et al. 2019) is compatible with the three pillars of 
CSA. Sustainable intensification, a framework which centers around a need for increased agricultural 
production  within  environmental  constraints  also  complements  CSA  (Campbell  et  al.  2014).  The 
literature reports examples of mitigation co-benefits of adaptation actions, with evidence from various 
regions (Chapter 7, Thornton and Herrero (2015), Thornton et al. (2018)). 

Conservation agriculture, promoted for improving agricultural soils and crop diversity (Powlson et al. 
2016) can help build adaptive capacity (Smith et al. 2017; Pradhan et al. 2018a) and yield mitigation 
co-benefits  through  improved  fertiliser  use  or  efficient  use  of  machinery  and  fossil  fuels  (Cui  et  al. 
2018; Harvey et al. 2014; Pradhan et al. 2018a).  

There  is  a  complex  set  of  barriers  to  implementation  of  farming-system  approaches  for  climate 
mitigation  (7.6.4),  suggesting  a  need  for  deliberate  shifts  in  development  pathways  to  achieve 
significant progress in this sector. The link between NDCs and mitigation in the land use sector can 
provide impetus for such policies. For example, there are multiple agricultural mitigation options that 
southeast  Asian  countries  could  use  to  meet  NDCs  that  would  have  an  important  adaptive  impact 
(Amjath-Babu et al. 2019). 

Some agricultural practices considered sustainable have trade-offs, and their implementation can have 
negative effects on adaptation or other ecosystem services. Fast-growing tree monocultures or biofuel 
crops may enhance carbon stocks but reduce downstream water availability and decrease availability of 
agricultural  land  (Windham-Myers  et  al.  2018;  Kuwae  and  Hori  2019).  In  some  dry  environments 
similarly, agroforestry can increase competition with crops and pastures, decreasing productivity, and 
reduce catchment water yield (Schrobback et al. 2011).  

Agricultural practices can adapt to climate change while decreasing CO2 emissions on the farm field. 
However, if such a practice leads to lower yields, interconnections of the global agricultural system can 
lead  to  land  use  change  elsewhere  and  a  net  increase  in  GHG  emissions  (Erb  et  al.  2016). 
Implementation of sustainable agriculture can increase or decrease yields depending on context (Pretty 
et al. 2006).  

Blue carbon and mitigation co-benefits of adaptation actions 
The Paris Agreement recognises that mitigation co-benefits resulting from Parties’ adaptation actions 
and/or economic diversification plans can contribute to mitigation outcomes (UNFCCC 2015: Article 
4.7).  Blue  carbon  refers  to  biologically-driven  carbon  flux  or  storage  in  coastal  ecosystems  such  as 
seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves  (Wylie et al. 2016; Fennessy et al. 2019; Fourqurean et al. 
2012; Tokoro et al. 2014) (see Cross-Chapter Box 8 on blue carbon as a storage medium and removal 
process).  

Restoring or protecting coastal ecosystems is a mitigation action with synergies with adaptation and 
development.  Such  restoration  has  been  described  as  a  ‘no  regrets’  mitigation  option  in  the  Special 
Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (Bindoff et al. 2019) and advocated as a

climate solution at national scales (Bindoff et al. 2019; Taillardat et al. 2018; Fargione et al. 2018) and 
global scales  (Howard et al. 2017). On a per-area basis, carbon stocks in coastal ecosystems can be 
higher than in terrestrial forests (Howard et al. 2017), with below-ground carbon storage up to 1000 tC 
ha-1 (Crooks et al. 2018; McLeod et al. 2011; Bindoff et al. 2019). Overall, coastal vegetated systems 
have a mitigation potential of around 0.5% of current global emissions, with an upper limit of less than 
2% (Bindoff et al. 2019). 

Restoration or protection of coastal ecosystems is an important adaptation action with multiple benefits, 
with  bounded  global  mitigation  benefits  (Gattuso  et  al.  2018;  Bindoff  et  al.  2019).  Such 
restoration/preservation reduces coastal erosion and protects from storm surges, and otherwise mitigates 
impacts of sea level rise and extreme weather along the coast line (Siikamäki et al. 2012; Romañach et 
al. 2018; Alongi 2008). Restoration of tidal flow to coastal wetlands inhibits methane emissions which 
occur  in  fresh  and  brackish  water  (Kroeger  et  al.  2017)  (7.4.2.8  describes  a  more  inclusive  set  of 
ecosystem services provided by coastal wetlands). Coastal habitat restoration projects can also provide 
significant social benefits in the form of job creation (through tourism and recreation opportunities), as 
well as ecological benefits through habitat preservation (Edwards et al. 2013; Sutton-Grier et al. 2015; 
Sutton-Grier and Moore 2016; Kairo et al. 2018; Wylie et al. 2016; Bindoff et al. 2019).  

Coastal ecosystem-based mitigation can be cost-effective, but interventions should be designed with 
care. One concern is to assure that actions remain effective at higher levels of climate change (Alongi 
2015; Bindoff et al. 2019). Also, methane emissions from ecosystems may partially reduce the benefit 
of the carbon sequestration (Rosentreter et al. 2018) depending on the salinity (Poffenbarger et al. 2011; 
Kroeger et al. 2017). As the main driver of mangrove forest loss is aquaculture/agriculture (Thomas et 
al. 2017), there may be entrenched interests opposing restoration and protection actions. 

Restoration and protection of terrestrial ecosystems 
Restoration  of  terrestrial  landscapes  can  be  a  direct  outcome  of  development  pathways,  and  can  be 
critical to achieving a variety of SDGs (especially 1, 2, 6, 8, 13, 15) (Lapola et al. 2018; Vergara et al. 
2016) although it also presents risks and can have trade-offs with other SDGs (Cao et al. 2010; Dooley 
and  Kartha  2018).  Landscape  restoration  is  nearly  always  a  mitigation  action,  and  can  also  provide 
adaptive  capacity.  While  policy  in  Brazil  has  tended  to  focus  on  the  Amazon  as  a  carbon  sink,  the 
mitigation co-benefits of ecosystem-based adaptation actions have been highlighted in the literature (Di 
Gregorio et al. 2016; Locatelli et al. 2011). A study of potential restoration of degraded lands in Latin 
America  (Vergara  et  al.  2016)  indicates  that  substantial  benefits  for  mitigation,  adaptation,  and 
economic development accrue after several years, underscoring a reliance on deliberate development 
choices.  In  agricultural  contexts,  restoration  is  a  development  choice  that  can  enhance  adaptive  and 
mitigative capacity via impact on farmer livelihoods. 

Preventing  degradation  of  landscapes  can  support  both  mitigation  and  adaptation  (IPCC  2019). 
Restoration of ecosystems is associated with improved water filtration, ground water recharge and flood 
control and multiple other ecosystem services (Ouyang et al. 2016). 

Restoration projects must be designed with care. There can be trade-offs in addition to the synergies 
noted  above  (7.6.4.3).  Restorations  may  be  unsuccessful  if  not  considered  in  their  socio-economic 
context  (Lengefeld  et  al.  2020;  Iftekhar  et  al.  2017;  Jellinek  et  al.  2019).  Restoration  projects  for 
mitigation  purposes  can  be  more  effective  if  done  with  adaptation  in  mind  (Gray  et  al.  2011)  as  a 
changing  climate  may  render  some  mitigation  actions  biophysically  infeasible  (Arneth  et  al.  2021). 
Landscape  restoration  projects  intended  for  CDR  may  underperform  due  to  future  release  of  stored 
carbon, or deferral of storage until after irreversible climate change effects (e.g. extinctions) (Dooley 
and Kartha 2018).

Afforestation  plans  have  received  substantial  attention  as  a  climate  mitigation  action,  with  ongoing 
unresolved debate on the feasibility and tradeoffs of such plans. Such afforestation programs can fail 
for biophysical reasons (7.4.2.2, Fleischman et al. 2020) but also lack of consideration of socioeconomic 
and development contexts (Fleischman et al. 2020). 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

4.4.3  Risks and uncertainties 

Shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation are complex endeavours that carry risks. 
Some  of  these  risks  can  be  easily  captured  by  quantitative models.  Others  are  better  understood via 
qualitative  approaches,  such  as  qualitative  narrative  storylines  (told  in  words)  and  methods  mixing 
qualitative and quantitative models (Kemp-Benedict 2012; Hanger-Kopp et al. 2019). The following 
outline key risks and relevant hedging strategies identified in the literature. 

4.4.3.1  Actions by others not consistent with domestic efforts 
The  international  context  is  a major source  of  uncertainty  for  national-level  planning, especially for 
small- or medium-sized open economies, because the outcome of domestic choices may significantly 
depend on decisions made by other countries and actor, over which national governments have limited 
or no control (Lachapelle and Paterson 2013). Availability of foreign financial resources in countries 
with limited domestic savings (Baum et al. 2017) and availability of technology transfers (Glachant and 
Dechezleprêtre 2017) are some examples. Other external decisions with significant bearing on domestic 
action include mitigation policies in other countries (Dai et al. 2017), and especially in major trading 
partners, the lack of which can result in competitive disadvantage for sectors exposed to international 
competition (Alton et al. 2014). The international prices of the key commodities (notably energy), goods 
and services are important, notably when shifting development pathway is based on structural change 
(e.g., Willenbockel et al. (2017) for Ghana and Kenya). 

Remedies include first devising policy packages that are, to the extent possible, robust to uncertainty 
regarding  external  decisions.  For  example,  mitigation  in  the  building  sector  is  considered  less 
problematic  for  competitiveness  since  the  construction  sector  is  less  exposed  to  international 
competition. Remedies also include securing international cooperation to reduce the uncertainty that 
domestic decision-makers face about the international context. Shifting investments towards low-GHG 
solutions requires a combination of conducive public policies, attractive investment opportunities and 
financing  of  transitions  (15.6),  which  can  enable  shifting  development  pathways.  Cooperation  can 
generate positive spill overs through technology diffusion (13.6.6). Third, cooperation is not limited to 
governments. As discussed in section 4.2.3, international cooperative initiatives among non-State actors 
(cities,  economic  branches,  etc.)  can  also  provide  know-how,  resources  and  stable  cooperative 
frameworks that reduce uncertainty for individual actors (14.5.5). 

4.4.3.2  Parts of complex policy packages fail 
As outlined in the examples in section 4.4.1 above, shifting development pathways and accelerating 
mitigation are complex endeavours, on which there is limited experience and know-how from the past. 
An uncertainty is that parts of these policy packages may fail, i.e., under-deliver relative to the amount 
of mitigation and of transformations initially expected. For example, France has failed to meet its 2015-
2018 carbon budget as housing retrofitting programs, in particular, have failed to deliver the expected 
amount of emission reductions (Haut Conseil pour le Climat 2019). There are two main options to tackle 
this risk. The first is to build in redundancy. The second is to anticipate that some parts of the policies 
will inevitably fail, and build-in monitoring and corrective mechanisms in a sequential decision-making 
process. To this regard, building institutions that can properly monitor, learn from and improve over 
time is critical (Nair and Howlett 2017).

4.4.3.3  New information becomes available 
The  science  on  climate  change,  its  impacts  and  the  opportunities  to  mitigate  is  continuously  being 
updated. Even though decisions are no longer made “in a sea of uncertainty” (Lave 1991), we know 
that  new  information  will  come  over  time,  that  may  have  significant  bearing  on  the  design  and 
objectives of policies to shift development pathways and accelerate mitigation. New information may 
come from climate sciences (e.g., updated GWP values or available carbon budgets) (Quéré et al. 2018), 
impact sciences (e.g., re-evaluation of climate impacts associated with given emission pathways) (Ricke 
et  al.  2018)  or  mitigation  sciences  (e.g.,  on  availability  of  given  technologies)  (Lenzi  et  al.  2018; 
Giannousakis et al. 2020).  

At the same time, economic and social systems are characterised by high degree of inertia, via long-
lived capital stock or urban forms  (Lecocq and Shalizi 2014), or more broadly mutually reinforcing 
physical, economic, and social constraints (Seto et al. 2016) that may lead to carbon lock-ins (Erickson 
et al. 2015). Risks associated with long-lasting fossil-fuel power plants have been the object of particular 
attention. For example, Pfeiffer et al. (2018) estimate that even if the current pipeline of power plants 
was cancelled, about 20% of the existing capacity might be stranded to remain compatible with 1.5°C 
or  2°C  pathways—implying  that  additional  capital  accumulation  would  lead  to  higher  sunk  costs 
associated with stranded assets (Luderer et al. 2018b; Johnson et al. 2015; Ansar et al. 2013; Kriegler 
et al. 2018). 

In the presence of uncertainty and inertia (or irreversibilities), hedging strategies may be considered, 
that include selection of risk-hedging strategies and processes to adjust decisions as new information 
becomes available. The notion of hedging against risks is also prominent in the adaptation literature, as 
exemplified by the terminology of “climate resilient development” (Fankhauser and McDermott 2016) 
(WGII, Ch.18). There is also a growing literature on hedging strategies for individual actors (e.g., firms 
or investors) in the face of the uncertainties associated with mitigation (e.g., policy uncertainty or the 
associated carbon price uncertainty) (e.g., (Morris et al. 2018) or (Andersson et al. 2016)). On the other 
hand, there is often limited discussion of uncertainty and of its implication for hedging strategies in the 
accelerated  mitigation  pathway  literature.  Exceptions  include  (Capros  et  al.  2019),  who  elicit  “no-
regret”  and  “disruptive”  mitigation  options  for  the  EU  through  a  detailed  sensitivity  analysis,  and 
(Watson et al. 2015) who discuss flexible strategies for the U.K. energy sector transition in the face of 
multiple uncertainties. 

4.4.3.4  Black swans (e.g., COVID-19 crisis) 
As  the  current  COVID-19  crisis  demonstrates,  events  happen  that  can  derail  the  best-laid  plans. 
Unexpected events beyond the range of human experience until then are called ‘black swans’, given the 
expectation that all swans are white. The only point to note here is that such events may also provide 
opportunities. In the COVID-19 case, for example, the experience of conducting many activities on-
line, which reduces emissions from transport, may leave an imprint on how some of these activities are 
carried out in the post-COVID-19 world. Similarly, reduced air pollution seen during the pandemics 
may increase support for mitigation and strengthen the case for climate action. However, the emissions 
implications  of  recovery  packages  depend  on  choosing  policies  that  support  climate  action  while 
addressing the socio-economic implications of COVID-19 (Hepburn et al. 2020). Governments may be 
in a stronger position to do so due to their pivotal role in assuring the survival of many businesses during 
the pandemics. Given the magnitude of recovery packages and their implications (Pollitt et al. 2021), 
choosing  the  direction  of  recovery  packages  amounts  to  choosing  a  development  pathway  (Cross-
Chapter Box 1).

4.4.3.5  Transformations run into oppositions 

Chapter 4 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

As noted above, shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation involve a broad range of 
stakeholders and decision-makers, at multiple geographical and temporal scales. They require a credible 
and trusted process for reconciling perspectives and balancing potential side-effects, managing winners 
and losers and implementing compensatory measures to ensure an inclusive just transition (Newell and 
Mulvaney 2013; Miller and Richter 2014; Gambhir et al. 2018; Diffenbaugh and Burke 2019). Such 
processes  are  designed  to  manage  the  risk  of  inequitable  or  non-representative  power  dynamics 
(Helsinki Design Lab 2014; Kahane 2019; Boulle et al. 2015). More generally, stakeholder processes 
can  be  subject  to  regulatory  capture  by  special  interests,  or  outright  opposition  from  a  variety  of 
stakeholders.  Information  asymmetry  between  government  and  business  may  shape  the  results  of 
consultative processes. Long experience of political management of change demonstrates that managing 
such risks is not easy, and requires sufficiently strong and competent institutions (Stiglitz 1998). The 
next section on Just Transition (4.5) addresses this issue. 

 

 

4.5  Equity, including just transitions 

Equity is an ethical and at times economic imperative, but it is also instrumentally an enabler of deeper 
ambition for accelerated mitigation (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2019). The literature supports a range of 
estimates of the net benefits—globally or nationally—of low-carbon transformation, and it identifies a 
number  of  difficulties  in  drawing  definitive  quantitative  conclusions  (e.g.,  comparisons  of  costs  & 
benefits  among  different  actors,  the  existence  of  non-economic  impacts,  comparison  across  time, 
uncertainty  in  magnitude,  3.6).  One  of  the  most  important  of  these  dimensions  is  the  distributional 
consequences of mitigation, as well as a range of equity considerations arising from the uncertainty in 
net benefits, as well as from the distribution of costs and benefits among winners and losers (Rendall 
2019; Caney 2016; Lahn and Bradley 2016; Lenferna 2018a; Kartha et al. 2018b; Robiou Du Pont et 
al.  2017).  Some  equity  approaches  are  even  just  seeking  corrective  justice  including  for  historical 
emissions (Adler 2007). For an assessment of literature on fairness in NDCs, see 4.2.2.7. 

Equity issues are often discussed in the literature via frameworks that are well-founded in the ethical 
literature and that have a strong bearing on effort-sharing, but have not yet been quantitatively modelled 
and expressed in the form of an emissions allocation quantified framework. These include, for example, 
ethical perspectives based in human rights (Johl and Duyck 2012), human capabilities (Klinsky et al. 
2017b), environmental justice (Mohai et al. 2009; Schlosberg 2009), ecological debt (Srinivasana et al. 
2008;  Warlenius  et  al.  2015),  transitional  justice  (Klinsky  2017;  Klinsky  and  Brankovic  2018),  and 
planetary boundaries (Häyhä et al. 2016).  

While there is extensive literature on equity frameworks for national emissions allocations (CSO Equity

focus on allocation of a global carbon budget among countries based on quantified equity frameworks. 
The implicit normative choices made in these analysis have limitations (Kartha et al. 2018a). Moreover, 
there  are  many  ethical  parameters  that  could  be  introduced  to  enrich  the  existing  quantitative 
frameworks,  such  as  progressivity  (Holz  et  al.  2018),  consumption-based  accounting  (Afionis  et  al. 
2017),  prioritarianism  (Adler  and  Treich  2015),  and  a  right  to  development  (Moellendorf  2020). 
Introducing these ethical frames into conventional quantification approaches generally implies greater 
allocations for poorer and lower-emitting populations, suggesting that the approaches that are typically

highlighted in emissions allocation analyses tends to favour wealthier and higher-emitting countries. 
Broader, more inclusive sharing of costs and burdens is seen as a way to enhance equity in procedures 
and outcomes. 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

Ultimately, equity consequences depend on how costs and benefits are initially incurred and how they 
are  shared  as  per  social  contracts  (Combet  and  Hourcade  2017),  national  policy,  and  international 
agreements. The literature suggests a relationship between the effectiveness of cooperative action and 
the perception of fairness of such arrangements. Winkler et al. (2018) demonstrate that countries have 
put forward a wide variety of indicators and approaches for explaining the fairness and ambition of their 
NDCs,  reflecting the  broader  range  of  perspectives  found  in  the  moral  philosophical  literature  cited 
above. Mbeva and Pauw (2016) further find that adaptation and financing issues take on greater salience 
in the national perspectives reflected in the NDCs. 

Topics of equity and fairness have begun to receive a greater amount of attention within the energy and 
climate literature, namely through the approaches of gender and race (Pearson et al. 2017; Lennon 2017; 
Allen et al. 2019), climate justice (Roberts and Parks 2007; Routledge et al. 2018) (Roberts & Parks, 
2006; Routledge et al. 2018), and energy justice (Sovacool and Dworkin 2014). While such approaches 
frequently envision justice and equity as an ethical imperative, justice also possesses the instrumental 
value of enabling deeper and more socially acceptable mitigation efforts (Klinsky and Winkler 2018). 

A concrete focal point on these issues has been that of “just transition”. Getting broad consensus for the 
transformational changes entailed in moving from a high- to a low-carbon economy means ‘leaving no 
one  behind’,  i.e.,  ensuring  (sufficiently)  equitable  transition  for  the  relevant  affected  individuals, 
workers, communities, sectors, regions and countries (Newell & Mulvaney, 2013; Jasanoff 2018). The 
concept of a “just transition” owes its origin to the US trade union movement of the 1980s. The earliest 
version of a just transition was called the “Superfund for Workers” modelled on the 1980 Superfund 
program that designed federal funds for the clean-up of toxic substances from chemicals, mining and 
energy production (Stevis and Felli 2015). It was further taken up, for example in the collaboration of 
the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), the International Labour Organization (ILO) and 
the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) in promoting “green jobs” as integral elements of a just 
transition (ILO 2015; Rosemberg 2015). In recent years the concept of a “just transition” has gained 
increased  traction,  for  example  incorporated  in  the  outcome  of  the  Rio+20  Earth  Summit  and  more 
recently  recognised  in  the  preamble  of  the  Paris  Agreement,  which  states  “the  imperative  of  a  just 
transition  of  the  workforce  and  the  creation  of  decent  work  and  quality  jobs  in  accordance  with 
nationally  defined  development  priorities”  (UNFCCC  2015c).  Some  heads  of  state  and  government 
signed a Solidarity and Just Transition Silesia Declaration first introduced at COP24 in Poland (HoSG 
2018). 

The literature identifies targeted and proactive measures from governments, agencies, and authorities 
to ensure that any negative social, environmental or economic impacts of economy-wide transitions are 
minimised, whilst benefits are maximised for those disproportionally affected (Healy and Barry 2017). 
While  the  precise  definition  varies  by  source,  core  elements  tend  to  include:  (1)  investments  in 
establishing  low-emission  and  labour-intensive  technologies  and  sectors  (Mijn  Cha  et  al.  2020);  (2) 
research and early assessment of the social and employment impacts of climate policies  (Green and 
Gambhir  2020;  Mogomotsi  et  al.  2018);  (3)  social  dialogue  and  democratic  consultation  of  social 
partners and stakeholders (Smith 2017; Swilling and Annecke 2012); (4) the creation of decent jobs; 
active labour markets policies; and rights at work (UNFCCC 2016c; ILO 2015); (5) fairness in energy 
access  and  use  (Carley  and  Konisky  2020);  (6)  economic  diversification  based  on  low-carbon 
investments;  (7)  realistic  training/retraining  programs  that  lead  to  decent  work;  (8)  gender  specific 
politics that promote equitable outcomes (Allwood 2020); (9) the fostering of international cooperation

and coordinated multilateral actions (Lenferna 2018b; Newell and Simms 2020); (10) redressing of past 
harms and perceived injustices (UNHRC 2020; Setzer and Vanhala 2019); and (11) consideration of 
inter-generational  justice  concerns,  such  as  the  impacts  of  policy  decisions  on  future  generations 
(Newell & Mulvaney, 2013). 

IPCC AR6 WGIII 

A  just  transition  could  therefore  entail  that  the  state  intervenes  more  actively  in  the  eradication  of 
poverty,  and  creates  jobs  in  lower-carbon  sectors,  in  part  to  compensate  for  soon-to-be  abandoned 
fossil-fuel-based sectors, and that governments, polluting industries, corporations and those more able 
to  pay  higher  associated  taxes  pay  for  transition  costs,  provide  a  welfare  safety  net  and  adequate 
compensation  for  people,  communities,  places,  and  regions  that  have  been  impacted  by  pollution, 
marginalised or negatively impacted by a transition from a high- to low-carbon economy and society 
(Muttitt and Kartha 2020; Le Billon and Kristoffersen 2020; Kartha et al. 2018b). Reducing climate 
impacts is another important dimension of equity, in that the poor who are least responsible for climate 
change  are  most  vulnerable  to  its  impacts  (WGII,  Chapter  8).  Focusing  on  financial  losses  alone 
however can obscure an important distinction between losses incurred by corporations and states and 
losses experienced by workers and communities. Processes established in the name of a just transition 
are  also  at  risk  of  being  co-opted  by  incumbent  interests  and  powerful/wealthy  agents  (Green  and 
Gambhir, 2020). Policy interventions associated with good governance, democratic oversight, and legal 
recourse  can  help  overcome  attempted  co-optation  of  just  transition,  or  use  of  COVID-19  recovery 
packages for continued carbon lock-in (Hepburn et al. 2020; SEI et al. 2020). 

The  just  transition  concept  has  thus  become  an  international  focal  point  tying  together  social 
movements, trade unions, and other key stakeholders to ensure equity is better accounted for in low-
carbon transitions and to seek to protect workers and communities. It also forms a central pillar of the 
growing movement for a ‘Green New Deal’—a roadmap for a broad spectrum of policies, programs, 
and legislation that aims to rapidly decarbonises the economy while significantly reducing economic 
inequality (Galvin and Healy 2020)(Allam et al. 2021) The US Green New Deal Resolution (Ocasio-
Cortez 2019) for example positions structural inequality, poverty mitigation, and a just transition at its 
centre. The European Green Deal proposed in 2019 (European Commission 2019), including a UDF100 
billion “Just Transition Mechanism” to mitigate the social effects of transitioning away from jobs in 
fossil based industries. National level green new deals with strong just transition components have been 
proposed  in  South  Korea, Australia,  Spain,  UK,  Puerto  Rico,  Canada,  as  well  as  regional  proposals 
across Latin America and the Caribbean (Pollin 2020). .

A just transition at national, regional and local scales can help to ensure that workers, communities, 
frontline  communities  and  the  energy-poor  are  not  left  behind  in  the  transition.  Moreover,  a  just 
transition necessitates that rapid decarbonisation does not perpetuate asymmetries between richer and 
poorer states and people (UNHRC 2020). Alliances around a just transition in countries across the world 
take many forms (Box 4.6).

Union Green Deal, and Panel C shows the European Union’s Platform for Coal Regions in Transition. 

As Figure 4.9 shows, no fewer than 7 national commissions or task forces on a just transition existed as 
of  2020  as  well  as  7  other  sets  of  national  policies  and  a  multitude  of  other  actors,  networks,  and 
movements.  For  instance,  the  German  phase-out  of  coal  subsidies  involved  a  savings  package  for 
unemployed miners. Subsidy reform packages introduced by Iran, Namibia, the Philippines, Turkey, 
and the United Kingdom provide similar compensating measures to affected groups (Sovacool 2017). 
Spain’s just transition plan for coal miners includes early retirement, redundancy packages, silicosis 
compensation, retraining for green jobs, and priority job placement for former miners. 

 

4.6  Knowledge gaps 

This section summarises knowledge gaps that require further research: 

•  Literature on mitigation pathways at the national level remains skewed towards large emitters. 
Many low-income countries have very few or no studies at all (Lepault and Lecocq 2021) (4.2) 
(Annex  III).  Development  of  new  studies  and  inclusion  of  associated  scenarios  in  updated 
mitigation national mitigation pathway database would enhance understanding of mitigation at 
national level. 

•  Ex ante and ex post analysis of mitigation action and of mitigation plans by non-state actors, 

and their relationship with mitigation action and plans by governments is limited (4.2.3). 

•  System  analysis  solutions  are  only  beginning  to  be  recognised  in  current  literature  on  deep 

mitigation pathways, and rarely included in existing national policies or strategies (4.2.5). 

•  While  the  technology  elements  of  accelerated  mitigation  pathways  at  national  level  are 
generally well documented, studies of the economic and social implications of such pathways 
remain scarce (4.2.6). 

•  Literature on the implication of development choices for emissions and for capacity to mitigate 
is limited (4.3.2). In particular, more contributions from the research community working on 
development issues would be very useful here. 

•  Literature describing shifts in development pathways, and the conditions for such shifts (based 
on  past  experience  or  on  models)  remains  scarce  (4.3.1,  4.3.3,  4.4.1).  Studying  shifts  in 
development pathways requires new ways of thinking with interdisciplinary research and use 
of alternative frameworks and methods suited for understanding of change agents, determinants 
of change and adaptive management among other issues (Winkler 2018). Research is not only 
expected to produce knowledge and boost innovation, but also to help identify transformation 
pathways  and  to  enlighten  public  debate  and  public  decision  making  on  related  political 
choices.  

•  Other research gaps concern the open ocean and blue carbon. There is limited knowledge about 
quantification  of  the  blue  carbon  stocks.  Research  is  required  into  what  happens  if  the 
sequestration capacity of the ocean and marine ecosystems is damaged by climate change to 
the tipping point until the sink becomes an emitter, and on how to manage blue carbon (4.4.2). 

•  Knowledge is limited on: i) linking equity frameworks on mitigation with adaptation and most 
importantly with loss and damage, ii) applying ethical parameters to enrich many of the existing 
quantitative  frameworks,  to  assess  fairness  and  ambition  of  NDCs;  iii)  extending  equity

Frequently asked questions 

FAQ 4.1 What is to be done over and above countries existing pledges under the Paris Agreement 

to keep global warming well below 2C? 
Current pledges and efforts under the PA aimed at keeping global warming below 2°C are not enough, 
falling  short  by  14-23  GtCO2-eq  (Cross-Chapter  Box  4).  There  is  a  further  shortfall  of  about  4  to  7 
GtCO2-eq in 2030 if the conditions are not fulfilled for those Parties that have made their pledges with 
conditions for support (4.2.2.3). To cover up for these shortfalls will require taking actions across all 
sectors that can substantially reduce GHG emissions. Examples of such actions include shifting to low- 
or zero-emission power generation, such as renewables; changing food systems, such as diet changes 
away from land-intensive animal products; electrifying transport and developing ‘green infrastructure’, 
such  as  building  green  roofs,  or  improving  energy  efficiency  by  smart  urban  planning,  which  will 
change the layout of many cities. Because these different actions are connected, it means all relevant 
companies, industries and stakeholders would need to be involved to increase the support and chance 
of  successful  implementation  (4.2.5).  The  deployment  of  low-emission  technology  depends  upon 
economic  conditions  (e.g.,  employment  generation  or  capacity  to  mobilize  investment),  but  also  on 
social/cultural conditions (e.g., awareness and acceptability) and institutional conditions (e.g., political 
support  and  understanding),  and  the  provision  of  relevant  enabling  conditions  (4.4.1).  Encouraging 
stronger and more ambitious climate action by non-government and subnational stakeholders, as well 
as  international  cooperative  initiatives  (ICIs)  could  make  significant  contributions  to  emissions 
reduction (4.2.3). 

FAQ  4.2  Option  1:  What  is  to  be  done  in  the  near-term  to  accelerate  mitigation  and  shift 
development pathways?  
Increasing speed of implementation, breadth of action across all sectors of the economy, and depth of 
emission  reduction  faces important  obstacles, that are  rooted in  the  underlying structure  of  societies 
(4.2.7). Addressing these obstacles amounts to shifting away from existing developmental trends (i.e., 
shifting development pathways, Cross-Chapter Box 5). This can be done by strengthening governance 
and institutional capacity, aligning technology and innovation systems with low-carbon development, 
facilitating  behaviour  change  and  providing  adequate  finance  within  the  context  of  multi-objective 
policy packages and sequences (4.4.1). Shifting development pathways towards sustainability broadens 
the scope for, and is thus a complement to, accelerated mitigation (4.3). 

FAQ 4.3 Is it possible to accelerate mitigation in the near-term while there are so many other 
development priorities? (education, health, employment, etc.) 
It is possible to accelerate mitigation while addressing other developmental priorities by implementing 
measures that simultaneously address both climate and development goals.  Casting mitigation in the 
broader context of development pathways provides additional opportunities to articulate both (4.3.1.4). 
Policies  such  as  progressive  taxation,  investment  in  public  transport,  regulatory  transparency, 
commitment  to  multi-lateral  environmental  governance,  fiscal  incentives  for  private  investments, 
international technology development and transfer initiatives, and risk disclosure and efforts to improve 
underlying enabling conditions (improving governance and institutional capacity, fostering behavioural 
change  and  technological  innovation,  and  provision  of  finance)  address  multiple  objectives  beyond 
mitigation, such as job creation, macro-economic stability, economic growth, public health and welfare, 
providing energy access, providing formal housing, and providing mobility. How we manage our land 
and  agriculture,  growing  cities,  transport  needs,  our  industries,  and  the  way  people  are  trained  and

employed all impact on GHG emissions and the options we have to reduce them. In turn, reducing GHG 
emissions can also contribute to reducing poverty, preventing hunger, improving health and wellbeing, 
and providing clean water and clean energy. Implementing right policies and investments can help to 
address the challenges of how to reduce emissions without constraining development. For example, in 
land use, widespread planting of a single tree species or crops for bioenergy (organic matter turned into 
renewable energy) could affect food and water supplies. Therefore, if bioenergy is to be relied upon to 
offset emissions, the right policies and investments are needed (see also Chapter 17).
