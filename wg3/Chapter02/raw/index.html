This reflects  agricultural  intensification  and  technological  progress.  However,  in  most  regions  this  was mirrored by an increase in output per capita, meaning that absolute GHG emissions in  most regions increased over the last decade. A significant increase in total A</span><a href="annotation_emissions_dict.html#id11729_1">FOLU</a><span> emissions occurred in Africa, driven by both increased GHG emissions per unit of land and increased populations (Figure 2.21).  </span></li><li><span>The A</span><a href="annotation_emissions_dict.html#id11736_1">FOLU</a><span> sector and its emissions impacts are closely tied to global supply chains, with countries in Latin  America  and  South-East  Asia  using  large  portions  of  their  land  for  agricultural  and  forestry products exported to other countries (see Chapter 7). The strong increases in production per capita and associated GHG emissions seen in these regions are at least partly attributable to growing exports and not  national  food  system  or  dietary  changes.  At  the  same  time,  efforts  to  promote  environmental sustainability in regions like the EU and the USA (but also fast-growing emerging economies such as China) can take place at the cost of increasing land displacement elsewhere to meet their own demand (Meyfroidt et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2013; Creutzig et al., 2019).  </span></li><li><span>Global diets are a key driver of production per capita, and thus land pressure and A</span><a href="annotation_emissions_dict.html#id11746_1">FOLU</a><span> emissions (Chapter  7).

Very high calorie diets have high total GHG emissions per capita (Heller and Keoleian, 2015) and are common in the developed world (Pradhan et al., 2013). Over the  last  few  decades,  a  &#8220;westernisation&#8221;  of  diets  has  also  been  occurring  in  developing  countries (Pradhan et al., 2013). Low- and middle-income countries such as India, Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, and South Africa have experienced a rapid dietary shift towards western-style diets (De Carvalho et al., 2013; Pradhan et al., 2013; Popkin, 2015).

The  different  focus  in  these  metrics  can  have important  distributional  consequences,  depending  on  how  they  are  used  to  inform  emission  targets (Reisinger  et  al.,  2021;  Lynch  et al.,  2021), but  this has  only  begun to  be  explored  in  the  scientific literature. </span></li><li><span>) contribute to warming (also see Figure 2.4) as assessed in Working Group I (Forster et al., 2021c; Naik et al., 2021a). Many of these other short-lived climate forcers (</span><a href="annotation_emissions_dict.html#id6085_7">SLCF</a><span>s) are co-emitted during combustion processes in power plants, cars, trucks, airplanes, but also during wildfires and household activities such as traditional cooking with open biomass burning. As these co-emissions have implications for net warming, they are also considered in long-term emission reduction scenarios as covered in the literature (Smith et al., 2020; Rauner et al., 2020b; Vandyck et al., 2020; Harmsen et al., 2020) as well as Chapter 3 of this report. These air pollutants are also detrimental to human health (e.g. Lelieveld et al., 2015, 2018; Vohra et al., 2021). For example, Lelieveld et al. (2015) estimates a total of 3.3 (1.6-4.8) million pre-mature deaths in 2010 from outdoor air pollution. Reducing air-pollutants in the context of climate policies therefore lead to substantial co-benefits of mitigation efforts (Rauner et al., 2020a; Rao et al., 2017; Von Stechow et al., 2015; Lelieveld et al., 2019).

Additionally, its temperature response to emissions with shorter </span><a href="annotation_emissions_dict.html#id4197_1">atmospheric lifetime</a><span>s such as aerosols, methane or ozone has been adjusted to broadly match those presented in Naik et al.
