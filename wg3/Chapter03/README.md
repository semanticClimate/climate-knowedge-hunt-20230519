## What is semanticClimate? 
semanticClimate is a project which aims to convert climate related documents by the IPCC to a semantic form, understood by both humans and computers. 

## Why are such conversions required? </h4>
The goal is to extract useful information from the IPCC documents so that  relevant information could be made accessible for everyone to read and understand.

## What is IPCC?
