# Structure of the reports and the hackathon

The reports are large, and although highly structured are not easy to navigate. Our "IPCC Report Explorer" picks up the internal links (of the order of 10,000) and makes them machine-understandable. There's so much that we have only explored a fraction. Here's the plan:

# The reports (WGI, WGII, WGIII, SR15, SROCC, SRCCL)

There are 6 reports - which have been published over the last 3 years. They normally come out in draft, seeking final approval, and then are tidied into the final version. The draft and final are both PDF but use different styles so we need to be able to have software for both. The structure of a report is usually:

## Full report

Typically 2-4000 pages, all PDF. The sections/chapters below vary in number and some are omitted but this is typical. The ToC links to the chapters and the Chapter ToCs hyperlink to sections but otherwise the document is not machine processable. We note (!!) those sections that are frequently targetted and will be part of our knowledge graph.
